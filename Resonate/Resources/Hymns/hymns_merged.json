    "historicalContext": "Joachim Neander (1650–1680) wrote this hymn in 1680 while serving as assistant preacher at St. Martin’s Church in Bremen. The text is based primarily on Psalm 103:1–6 and Psalm 150. It was first published in Alpha and Omega, Joachimi Neandri Glaub- und Liebesübung (Bremen, 1680), in five stanzas of five lines each.\n\nThe English translation most widely used today was prepared by Catherine Winkworth (1827–1878) and appeared in her Chorale Book for England (1863). Winkworth omitted Neander’s fourth stanza, and the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal further omits Neander’s original final stanza.\n\nThe tune LOBE DEN HERREN (\"Praise the Lord\") takes its name from the opening words of Neander’s German hymn. Neander adapted the melody from a similar tune that appeared in Ander Teil des Erneuerten Gesangbuchs, printed in Stralsund in 1665. That version carried secular text, suggesting the possibility of an even earlier secular origin. In Chorale Book for England, the melody was harmonized by William Sterndale Bennett (1816–1875), professor of music at Cambridge and principal of the Royal Academy of Music, and Otto Goldschmidt (1829–1907), husband of the Swedish soprano Jenny Lind.",

    "historicalContext": "This chorale, often called the “Queen of the Chorales” (with “Wake, Awake,” SDAH 210, known as the “King”), was written by Philip Nicolai and published in his Freuden-Spiegel des ewigen Lebens (Mirror of the Joy of Eternal Life) in 1599. Both text and melody are Nicolai’s own work. The original German poem consisted of seven stanzas forming an acrostic on the name of one of his students, Wilhelm Ernst, Graf zu Waldeck.\n\nNicolai composed the hymn during a devastating outbreak of plague in the town of Unna, where he was serving as pastor. Surrounded by suffering and death, he sought to strengthen his congregation by directing their faith toward Christ, the eternal Bridegroom and Morning Star. The hymn reflects bridal imagery drawn especially from Psalm 45 and Revelation’s portrayal of Christ as the radiant Morning Star.\n\nThe melody WIE SCHÖN LEUCHTET takes its name from the opening words of the German text (“How brightly shines the Morning Star”). Its majestic, flowing structure has secured its place as one of the most beloved and enduring chorales of the Lutheran tradition, frequently used for weddings, festivals, and services emphasizing the hope of Christ’s return.",

    "authorBirthDeath": "1697–1769",
    "translator": "Hymnal 1940",
    "yearWritten": 1729,
    "historicalContext": "Gerhard Tersteegen was born November 25, 1697, at Moers, near Düsseldorf, West Germany. His parents wanted him to become a minister of the Reformed Church in Germany. But his father died when Gerhard was but 6 and his mother could not afford the university course, so his education stopped with the normal classical training in the Latin school. At 16 he was apprenticed to his brother-in-law as a silk weaver in Mülheim. After five years he attempted to operate his own business and did enough ribbon-weaving to have a living and to share with the poor. After a period of severe depression, during which he ceased attending churches, he was again convinced of the saving grace of Christ and signed a covenant with God with his own blood. From then on for the rest of his life he was known as a mystic, speaker at special prayer meetings, writer on devotional subjects, and author and translator of hymns.\n\nHe acquired a group of admiring followers who subscribed sufficient money to buy a house at Mülheim called “Pilgerhütte” (Pilgrim Cottage), where the “awakened souls” could go into a spiritual retreat under the direction of Tersteegen. In addition to labors for the poor and the sick, he traveled extensively, returning each year for a visit with his followers in Holland. He also carried on a tremendous volume of correspondence. After his death on April 3, 1769, at Mülheim at age 72, his followers mostly drifted back to the Reform Church.\n\nOf the more than 100 hymns he wrote, Julian lists 26 that were used extensively and gives this characterization of his poetry: “Inner union of the soul with God and Christ, the childlike simplicity and trust which this brings, renunciation of the world and of self, and daily endeavor to live as in the presence of God and in preparation for the vision of God, aret he keynotes of his hymns. To his intense power of realizing the unseen, his clear and simple diction, and the evident sincerity with which he sets forth his own Christian experience, his hymns owe much of their attractiveness and influence.”\n\nThis hymn, originally eight stanzas, was first published in his book Geistliches Blumen-garlein (Flower Garden of the Spirit), 1729. The translation here used was made by the committee working on the Episcopal Hymnal 1940. SDAH stanzas are Tersteegen’s 1, 8, and 3.\n\nA literal translation of what is the second stanza in SDAH is: “Lord, some dwell in me, Let my heart and my spirit be another temple for Thee.” There is no mention of Mary, the mother of Jesus, in the original, and the Hymnal 1940 translation, which has the virtue of rhymes between four pairs of the 10 lines, evidently brings in Mary to rhyme (poorly) with sanctuary.\n\nThe tune WUNDERBARKER KÖNIG is based on a melody Joachim Neander (1650-1680; see Biographies) included in his collection of 56 hymns Alpha and Omega, Glaub- und Liebesübung, Bremen, 1680, where it is set to the hymn beginning with the same words, “Wunderbarer König” (Marvelous King).",

    "authorBirthDeath": "1793–1847",
    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": 1834,
    "historicalContext": "This is a very free paraphrase of Psalm 103, first printed in a collection of 280 psalms Lyte made for his own congregation at Lower Brixham, Devonshire, in 1834, The Spirit of the Psalms. Where the psalm uses “Bless the Lord, O my soul,” Lyte changes it to the more exuberant “Praise, my soul, the King of Heaven.”  The stanza omitted is:\n\nFrail as summer’s flower we flourish,\nBlows the wind and it is gone;\nBut while mortals rise and perish,\nGod endures, unchanging on.\nPraise Him, praise Him, Alleluia.\nPraise the high eternal One.\n\nIn an era when many were insisting that versions of the psalms should be as close as the original wording as possible, the title of his book shows that he was breathing new life into these ancient songs, using his own words while preserving the “spirit.”\n\nHenry Francis Lyte was born June 1, 1793, at Ednam, Scotland; he was raised as an orphan and became a scholar at Trinity College, Dublin. For a time he considered studying medicine, but changed to theology. After graduation he served several parishes in Ireland and England, including Marazion in Cornwall, where he underwent a great spiritual change.\n\nIn 1823 he became pastor at a little fishing village, Lower Brixham, in Devonshire, England, where he stayed 24 years until his death in 1847. When King William the Fourth visited Brixham, he was so delighted with the reception accorded him at the church that he gave the house at Berry Head, overlooking Torbay, to Lyte as his residence. Here is where most of his hymns were written, many taken collections of his poetry. Julian lists 81 hymns that came from his Poems Chiefly Religious, 1833 and 1845. He gave himself wholeheartedly to these rough people of the sea. At one time he had nearly 800 children in the Sunday school, with some 70 teachers. Under a busy program his health broke down, and in spite of going to the Riviera to recover from tuberculosis, he died at Nice November 20, 1847, at the age of 54. He published Poems Chiefly Religious, 1833, enlarged in 1845, and Spirit of the Psalms, 1834, enlarged in 1836.\n\nOther hymns by Lyte in SDAH are: No. 25, “Praise the Lord, His Glories Show”; No. 50, “Abide With Me”; and No. 325, “Jesus, I My Cross Have Taken.”\n\nLAUDA ANIMA, the Latin for PRAISE, MY SOUL, another name by which this tune in known, first appeared in R. Brown Borthwick’s Supplemental Hymn and Tune Book, 1869. It was set to this text, in unison with organ accompaniment, and for four-part a cappella singing. SDAH uses three of the four setting found in Hymns Ancient and Modern, Revised, 1950, changing the note values from half and whole notes to quarter and half notes.\n\nErik Routley, in his Music of Christian Hymns, 1981, calls this tune a “masterpiece of simplicity and effectiveness, the only Goss tune that has remained in currency… that will last as long as hymnody lasts.” It was chosen as the opening processional hymn at the wedding of Princess (now Queen) Elizabeth to Prince Philip in 1947. She was following the tradition set by her mother, who also used this hymn when she married King George VI in 1923.\n\nThe tune noteworthy for the last score of melody, which is based on the descending scale, and for the harmony of the second score of the second setting, where the bass part ascends in an almost complete chromatic scale.\n\nSir John Goss was born December 27, 1800, at Fareham, England. His father was an organist, and he took naturally to music, becoming at age 11 a choir singer at the Chapel Royal in London. For a time he considered going into opera singing but decided for organ, serving in two churches before succeeding Thomas Atwood in1838 at St. Paul’s Cathedral, London. Here he built a reputation of distinction over 34 years, directing, playing,and composing. For 47 years, in 1827 to 1874, he taught harmony at the Royal Academy of Music. Queen Victoria knighted him in 1872, and Cambridge University conferred on him the D.Mus. in 1876. He wrote some 50 anthems and services, many hymn tunes, and a textbook on harmony. He was musical editor of an influential hymnbook, The Church Psalter and Hymn Book, 1856. Some British hymnologists as second only to Samuel S. Wesley among nineteenth-century church musicians. He died at Brixton, London, on May 10, 1880, and was buried in St. Paul’s Cathedral, London.",

    "historicalContext": "Joachim Neander (1650-1680; see Biographies) wrote the original of this hymn in German as a prayer for mealtime. Robert Seymour Bridges, appointed poet laureate of England in 1913, used only a portion of the first stanza of Neander’s poem as a basis for what in reality is an original hymn.\n\nThe hymn first appeared, along with some of his other hymns, in The Yattendon Hymnal, 1899, a supplement intended for use only in his own church at Yattendon, near Oxford. However, it later came to be considered one of the first attempts to improve the quality of English hymns, and editors of hymnbooks have been mining its riches ever since.\n\nBorn October 23, 1844, at Walmer, Kent, England, of a wealthy family, Bridges studied medicine at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital. He served in several London hospitals before tuberculosis forced his retirement at age 37. During the year 1924, he and his wife, Mary, were guests at the University of Michigan, where he received an honorary doctorate. The same honor was accorded him at Harvard and at Oxford and St. Andrews universities. Death came on April 21, 1930, at Boar’s Hill in Oxford.\n\nThe tune MICHAEL, written by Herbert Howells, was first published in the Clarendon Hymnbook, 1936. Its freshness and creativity of harmony and melody went almost unnoticed until about 1964, when it began to appear in several hymnals, among them the hymnal of the United Church of Christ, U.S.A., 1974.\n\nHowells, born October 17, 1892, at Lydney, Gloucestershire, studied with Herbert Brewer at Gloucester Cathedral and was his apprentice there from 1909 and 1911. The quality of his original compositions soon won him a scholarship at the Royal College of Music in London, where he studied with the great Charles V. Stanford (see SDAH 32), Hubert Parry, and Walford Davies. After a short stint as substitute organist at Salisbury Cathedral, he was in poor health for three years. Later he served as teacher of composition at the Royal College of Music for more than 50 years, and director of music at St. Paul’s Girls School, in London; he followed Gustav Holst in the latter position.\n\nHowells’ long list of compositions includes work for chorus, organ, and piano, as well as solos and church service music. In 1923 he toured the United States and Canada. He was granted a D.Music. from Cambridge University in 1961. Before his death he was much in demand as adjudicator of music competitions. Having been raised in the Congregational church and later holding membership in both the Church of England and the Methodist Church, respectively, he brought to his involvement in hymnody a rich experience. In 1965 he was appointed treasurer of the British Hymn Society. He died February 23, 1983.\n\nMICHAEL is used also for SDAH 59, “Great Our Joy as Now We Gather.”",

    "historicalContext": "Written in the summer of 1861 by John Monsell for Epiphany (the commemoration of the visit of the Wise Men to the Baby Jesus) under the title “For the Fourth Sunday After Easter,” this hymn was first published in Monsell’s Hymns of Love and Praise, 1863. It catches the happy spirit of the psalmist. The first line has an extra syllable, for it is an exact word-for-word rendering of Psalm 96:9, but the parallel scripture used by Monsell and lacking this “O” is found in 1 Chronicles 16:29, “Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness.” In the hymn the gifts of the Wise men—gold, frankincense, and myrrh— are shown to have their counterparts in the Christian’s offering of “gold of obedience, and incense of lowliness,” and “burden of carefulness.” The latter is also expressed as sorrows and represented by the bitter myrrh. Such gifts will be accepted as treasure indeed, just as precious as the gifts of the Magi in their worship of the Lord. There were five stanzas in the original, the last being a repetition of the first.\n\nJohn Samuel Bewley Monsell was born March 2, 1811, the son of the archdeacon of Londonderry, Ireland, and educated at Trinity College, Dublin. Ordained in 1834, he served several places in Ireland before going to England to be vicar of Egham, Surrey, 1853, and rector at St. Nicholas, Guilford, 1870. On April 9, 1875, while watching the reconstruction of his church, he fell from the roof, and died as a result. Nearly 300 hymns came from his pen and were published in 11 volumes of his poetry. He knew the power of congregational singing and urged that we should be “more fervent and joyous. We are too distant are reserved in our praises; we sing, not as we should sing to Him who is Chief among ten thousand, the Altogether Lovely.” Monsell also wrote the texts at SDAH 68, “On Our Way Rejoicing,” and SDAH 613, “Fight the Good Fight.”\n\nSOUTHAMPTON, named after the English shipping port, was composed by Edwin Barnes about the time he was assisting F.E. Belden (see Biographies) in editing The Seventh-day Adventist Hymn and Tune Book, 1886, which is known by the abbreviation Hymns and Tunes. He contributed 21 original tunes for that book. This tune was included in Christ in Song, 1908, and The Church Hymnal, 1941. This combination of Monsell’s text and Barnes’s tunes seems to be unique to SDA hymnody.\n\nEdwin Barnes was born on March 15, 1864, in Shirley, a suburb of Southampton, England. Although he had not traveled more than 2o miles from home in his first 17 years, he accepted an invitation from Dr. John Harvey Kellogg in 1881 to go to the United Stated to Battle Creek, Michigan, where he became organist for the Seventh-day Adventist Church there and a student at Battle Creek College. He made five trips to Europe to improve his knowledge in voice piano, and organ. He became a thorough teacher, as well as being head of the music Department at Battle Creek College for nearly 20 years. He raised the cultural standard of the city by bringing noted singers and musicians to assist in oratorio concerts. In 1903 he directed the chorus at the dedication of the new Battle Creek Sanitarium, which replaced the one that had been destroyed by fire the previous year.\n\nAt the time, many members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church became disaffected because of the influence of Kellogg, and it seems that Barnes, who had been sponsored by Kellogg earlier, slowly drifted away from attendance. He became wrapped up in his music, in which he found fulfillment in the Congregational church and in the musical life of the city. Barnes formed an amateur music club and instituted an annual May festival of music at Battle Creek. He also operated the Battle Creek Conservatory of music, where piano, organ, voice, and violin were taught, but this closed in June 1926 because of his ill health. He served as organist and choir director in the First Congregational church Battle Creek, holding these positions for a continuous period of more than 30 years. He directed choral societies and orchestras, and on occasion directed the visiting New York and Chicago Symphony orchestra. In 1920 Hillsdale College, Michigan, conferred on him the honorary degree of Doctor of Music because of his outstanding service in this field. He composed many hymn tunes and organ pieces. Some of his hymn tunes were named after English towns, some even after towns in his home country of Hampshire. From 1926 his health deteriorated, and he died four years later at Battle Creek, Michigan, on April 11, 1930.\n\nThe passing of the years and usage by congregations have a way of winnowing out the “finest of the wheat.” In Hymns and Tunes Barnes had 20 original tunes. The Church Hymnal, 1941, cut that down to eight. Only two have been saved for SDAH, the other one being NO. 554, “MORTON,” for “O Let Me Walk With Thee”",

    "historicalContext": "Most of the Hymns of Fanny Crosby (1820-1915; see Biographies) are simple and earnest, many being subjective, and most of them are of the gospel-song type. The great hymnic authority John Julian says that her poems are weak and poor but have become popular because of the melodies associated with them. However, the strong words of this hymn are most appropriate to the majestic title and make an inspiring congregational hymn of praise.\n\nThe unnamed tune was composed by Hart Pease Danks (1834-1903) of New Haven, Connecticut, later of Chicago. Although a carpenter, Danks showed a keen interest in music and wrote more than 1000 songs appealing to popular taste. He was a boy soprano, and later a singer and choir conductor in Chicago. He also composed the unnamed tune for SDAH 427, “No Night There.”\n\nSignificantly, the first appearance of this hymn was in Hymns and Tunes, 1886 where in bore the notice “Copyrighted 1886 by the J.E. White Pub. Co.” How White obtained this one song remains a mystery, for most of the prolific output of Fanny Crosby was controlled by Bigelow and Main in Chicago. The Dictionary of American Hymnology first-line index shows that Song Sheaf, compiled by F.E. Belden and published by Hope Publishing Company in 1886, the Gospel Carols, by George J. Meyer, Chicago, 1905. So for the most part, this hymn, which some feel is one of Crosby’s best, has been an almost exclusive possession of Seventh-day Adventists, appearing in the seven of the church’s hymnbooks.",

    "yearWritten": 1625,
    "historicalContext": "This Anonymous old Dutch song is reminiscent of the struggles between the Protestant Netherlands and the Catholic Spanish oppressors at the time of the supremacy of Philip II of Europe. At the time of that king’s death in 1598, the United Provinces of the Northern section of the Netherlands continued their struggle for independence and gained a truce for 11 years. Although this truce did not recognize their independence and an attempt at reconquest was renewed, the Dutch republic became a sovereign state at that time under Maurice of Nassau.\n\nReligious warfare and divine guidance and deliverance are noted through all these stanzas, which enlarge upon Hebrew 13:6, “The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.” The lines were first written about 1625 and published in 1626 to celebrate the liberation of the Netherlands from Spain. The English translation by Baker was printed first in Coenraad V. Bos’s Dutch Folk-songs, 1917.\n\nTheodore Baker was born June 3, 1851, in New York. As a young man he was trained for a career in business. At age 23 he decided to switched to music, and went to Leipzig, Germany, for study with Oscar Paul. His doctoral thesis was the first serious study of the music of American Indians. In 1890 he returned to the United Stated to become musical editor and translator for the publishing house of G. Schirmer. He edited and published the monumental Baker’s Biographical Dictionary of Music and Musicians, which, under editorship of Nicolas Slonimsky, is now in its seventh edition. Baker’s Dictionary of Musical Terms went through more than 25 printing and sold more than 1 million copies. In 1926 he retired, and lived in Dresden, Germany, until his death in October 13, 1934. His other translation in SDAH is No. 131, “Lo, How a Rose E’er Blooming.”\n\nThe tune KREMSER is named after Eduard Kremser, a Biennese director of a male-voice singing society. He rediscovered the tune, originally a Dutch folk song appropriated by Adrian Valerius in his collection of Dutch songs published in Haarlem in 1626. Kremser used it in a collection of works he arranged for male chorus and orchestra, the Sech Altneiderlandische Volkslieder, 1877, all of which were from Valerius’ book, made 250 years earlier. Kremser was born April 10, 1838, and died November 26, 1914, in Vienna. He composed operatas, cantatas, and orchestral and piano music.",

    "authorBirthDeath": "1593–1633",
    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": 1633,
    "historicalContext": "This is one of the three hymns in SDAH taken from Herbert’s The Temple  (see SDAH 243 and 247). It was entitled “Antiphon,” denoting that it is in two parts, refrain and verse, to be sung alternately, by two different groups. The refrain was to be sung by the full choir, and the verse divided in halves, the first to be sung by those on the south side of the choir (decani), and the other half by those on the north side (cantori). The hymn can be sung, of course, with the refrain by the congregation, and the verse in full by the choir, which would also be an antiphon; or it can be shared between two halves of the congregation.\n\nThe hymn echoes the invitation of part of Psalm 98:4-6: “Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise. Sing unto the Lord with… the voice of a psalm… Make a joyful noise before the Lord, the King.”\n\nGeorge Herbert was born April 3, 1593, at Montgomery Castle, central Wales; be became a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, 1615. We are indebted to Isaac Walton for writing about the lives of some of his friends, including Herbert. The following quotes gives us a clear picture. At age 12 in Westminster School, London: “The beauties of his (Herbert’s) pretty behavior and wit shined and became so evident and lovely in this, his innocent age, that he seemed to be marked out for piety and to become the care of heaven and of a particular angel to guard and guide him.” At age 15 at Cambridge he was “perfect in the learned languages, and especially the Greek tongue,” and was made university orator. A favorite of King James I, he was ordained in 1626 and served the Leighton, Huntingdonshire, until hit by an  illness in 1629. Appointed rector of St. Andrew’s, Bemerton, in 1630, he stayed there three years until his death on March 1, 1633, at age 40.\n\nHerbert was a good musician and often would go to the cathedral at Salisbury, only a few miles away, to hear the great music. Then he would return home to have a “sing” with friends and what they called a “private musick meeting.” He would set one of his poem to music, then accompany himself on the lute or viol. The parsonage was in a shambles; he restored it at his own expense, engraving on the mantel these words:\n\nTO MY SUCCESSOR\n\nIf you chance for to find\nA new house to thy mind,\nAnd built without thy cost;\nBe good to the poor,\nAs God gives thee store,\n\nWalton also records how the people felt about Herbert’s ministry: “Some of the meaner sort of his parish did so love and reverence My. Herbert that they would let their plow rest when his bell rung to prayers, that they might also offer their devotion to God with him, and would then return back to their plow.”\n\nLord David Cecil said to him: “Born with an exquisitely Christian disposition, all humility and spontaneous Christian love, he cultivated it by a lifetime of devotion. Christ was to him as real a personality as any human being. His life story is the history of his revelation to Him.”\n\nThe tune LUCKINGTON is named after a village in the northwest part of Wiltshire, England. He tune was written for these words and included in the Oxford Hymn Book, 1908, for which Basil Harwood was the musical editor. Born on April 11, 1859, at Woodhouse, Gloucestershire, England, Harwood was educated at Charterhouse School and Trinity College, Oxford. Beginning in 1878, he served as organist three years at Trinity College, four years at St. Barnabas, Pimlico, five years at Ely Cathedral, and for 17 years at Christ Church, Oxford, during which time he completed the degree of D.Mus. He also held the positions of precentor of Keble College, sonductor of the Oxford Bach Choir, and choragus (chorus leader) of the University of Oxford. In 1909 he returned to Woodhouse, retired, and spent the next 40 years composing sacred service music, Communion setting, anthems, cantatas, and organ works. Of the more than 90 hymn tunes we wrote, only are few are still in use. He died at London on April 3, 1949. SDAH uses his THORNBURY at No. 351 for “Thy Hand, O God, Has Guided.”",

    "yearWritten": 1843,
    "historicalContext": "The original first line was “Come, children, join to sing,” first published in a children’s book, Sacred Melodies for Sabbath School and Families, 1843. After a revision in 1854, when the stanzas were cut from five to the present three, this book enjoyed phenomenal success, selling more than 6 million copies in 27 years. It was known as the “Sabbath School Book” of Scotland. Bateman was born August 9, 1813, at Wyke, Scotland; he served as a Moravian pastor; later changing to lead Congregational churches in Edinburgh, Hopton, and Reading. In 1869 he was ordained in the Church of England and was pastor for several parishes before retirement in 1884. He also published, in 1872, The Children’s Hymnal and Christian Year. Death came at Carlisle, England, July 26, 1889.\n\nThe tune MADRID comes from a melody popular about 1825. Benjamin Carr, born September 12, 1768 (some say 1769), in London, was later a successful music publisher, composer, organist, and pianist in America. He published a piano version titled Spanish Hymn Arranged and Composed for the Concerts of the Musical Fund Society of Philadelphia by Benjamin Carr, The Air From and Ancient Spanish Melody, Philadelphia, 1826. The tune is also known as SPANISH HYMN, which is used for a shorter version at SDAH 295, “Chief of Sinners.” Carr died in Philadelphia on May 24, 1831. David Evans (187401948; see Biographies), the arranger of the tune, was a music teacher and composer who greatly influenced the musical life of Wales.",

    "historicalContext": "The Jewish creed was first formulated by Moses ben Maimonides (1135-1204) and consisted of 13 articles of faith; these were converted to a metrical version about a century and a half afterward. It is known as the Yigdal, which is the first word of the metrical version and means “magnify” or “extol.” A literal translation of the first article is: “Extolled and praised be the living God, who exists unbounded by time.” It is sung at synagogues on the eve of festivals and of the Sabbath, and also in Jewish homes at family worship on Friday evening. Thomas Olivers translated the Yigdal from Hebrew into English, and gave it a decidedly Christian character by his very free paraphrase, although his first and last stanzas reflect the original thought of the beginning and the end of this creed. He entitles it “A Hymn to the God of Abraham,” and nearly every line echoes a Scripture text. There were originally 12 stanzas arranged in three groups of four in each. The hymn was written about 1770 and first published in a tract in 1772.\n\nOlivers was born in early September 1725 at Tregynon, Montgomeryshire, near Westpool in north central Wales; He lost both parents before he had passed his fifth birthday, and he was cared for by a succession of relatives, moving from one to another. He was apprenticed to a shoemaker, but by the time he was 18 years of age he was godless youth, poor, in debt, and miserable, and was compelled to leave his native village. He went to Bristol and there heard sermon by George Whitefield on “a brand plucked from the burning” (see Zech. 3:2). He took courage and hope, and was converted. He wished to join Whitefield’s band, but was dissuaded. However, with a changed lifestyle, he went back to Wales, paid his debts, and returned to Bristol to set up in his trade. He met John Wesley, who discerned Olivers’ latent talents and encouraged him to become one of his itinerant preachers. So in 1753 Olivers went as an evangelist to Cornwall and for 46 years until his death continued in this work. He assisted Wesley for some of his time in editorial work and also wrote a few hymns. He died suddenly in London in March 1799.\n\nThe meter of the hymn, as unusual 6.6.8.4. Doubled (the only one in SDAH), was governed by the melody that was given to Olivers y the public singer, Rabbi Leoni, or Myer Lyon (1751-1797). Leoni was a chorister at the Great Synagogue in London and also a less than successful opera singer at Covent Garden. He went to Dublin in 1772, stayed there for 12 years, returned briefly to London, and then from 1787 became chazzan or cantor, or superintendent of prayer meetings, of the English-German synagogue in Jamaica, where he died. He is commemorated by the name now given to the tune, LEONI. Some traditions claim that this melody was sung at the dedication of Solomon’s Temple, but it has not been traced back earlier than the seventeenth century. There is a close similarity tot he melody in a secular song, “Why, Soldiers, Why,” which was sung in 1729 at the Haymarket. Theater in London.",

    "author": "Henry van Dyke",
    "authorBirthDeath": "1852–1933",
    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": 1907,
    "historicalContext": "The Rev. Tertius van Dyke, son of the author, has given us the story of how this great hymn was written. In 1907 his father, Henry, was on a preaching mission to Williams College (Massachusetts), and a guest in the home of the president, Mr. Garfield. Coming down to breakfast one morning, Van Dyke placed a manuscript on the table and said, “Here is a hymn for you. Your mountains were my inspiration. It must be sung to the music of Beethoven’s ‘Hymn to Joy.’” Obviously he was deeply moved by the beauty of God’s power in nature, and penned these lines so that others, too, could capture a portion of his spiritual experience. It was printed in his Poems, 1911, and in The Hymnal (Presbyterian) that same year.\n\nOne of the most distinguished literary men of his generation, Henry van Dyke was born November 10, 1852, in German town, Pennsylvania, and received his education at Princeton College, a B.A. in 1873, and an M.A. in 1876. He graduated from Princeton Theological Seminary in 1877. He began his career as pastor of United Congregational church, Newport, Rhode Island, and went to the Brick Presbyterian Church in New York in 1883, were he gained a wide reputation as a powerful preacher. Moving to Princeton University in 1900, he taught English literature; his home, Avalon, became a stopping place for writers from both sides of the ocean.\n\nElected moderator of the Presbyterian General Assembly in 1902, he became a close personal friend of President Woodrow Wilson and was appointed minister to the Netherlands and Luxembourg in 1913. A partial list of his honors includes lecturer, University of Paris; Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature; the degree of D.C.L., awarded by Oxford University; commander, Legion of Honor; Doctor of Divinity and Doctor of Laws, awarded by several universities in the United States. His fame rested solidly on the book he wrote, the most successful of which was The Other Wise Man. His final contribution to the Presbyterian Church was his work on the Committee to Revise the Book of Common Worship, published in 1933. He died April 10, 1933;\n\nThe tune HYMN TO JOY was adopted from the melody of the final movement of Beethoven’s Ninth symphony, 1824, by Edward Hodges (1796-1867) in 1846. Hodges came to America from England in 1838, and was organist for more than 20 years in nEw York, first at St. John’s Episcopal Chapel and then at Trinity Church. (The tune had appeared early in Elam Ives, Jr.’s Mozart Collection, 1846, where it was set to three different texts.)\n\nLudwig van Beethoven never wrote a hymn tune as such, but several have been adapted from his large works. Born December 16, 1770, at Bonn, Germany, into a musical family, he showed his genius early. At age 12 he studied with Neefe, the court organist, sometimes paying there and in the royal theater. His teacher said of him: “He plays the clavier very skillfully and with power, reads at sight very well, and — to put it in a nutshell — he plays chiefly The Well-tempered Clavichord of Bach. Whoever knows this collection of preludes and fugues in all the keys —which might be called the nun plus ultra of art — will know what tis means.”\n\nBeethoven met and took a few lessons from Mozart at age 17, and later also studied with Haydn. In 1792 he settled in Vienna, where most of his magnificent instrumental masterpieces were composed. He was know as the “Napoleon of the piano,” and his skill on this instrument gave him access to the best court and social circles. Always confident of his gifts as a composer, he built on the conventions of those who preceded him and forged ahead into new territory in romantic expression and dynamic devices.\n\nHe first noticed symptoms of deafness in 1798, at age 28. For a while he was defiant, realizing how this would affect his life as a musician, where, ordinarily, hearing is everything. He said, “ I have often cursed the Creator for exposing His creatures to the merest accident, so that often the most beautiful buds are broken or destroyed thereby. Only think that my noblest faculty, my hearing, has greatly deteriorated.” After years of struggle with doctors and “cures,” he resigned himself that nothing could be done and became submissive. At the same time he found that his creative power as a composer was in no way impaired; in fact, it may have gained strength and vitality. Some of his greatest works were written during this time, including the cantata The Mount of Olives, a Mass in C, the Missa Solemni, his last piano sonatas, and string quartets. A mere list of his prodigious output fills 20 pages in Grove’s Dictionary of Music and Musicians. On the occasion of his conducting the premier performance of the Ninth Symphony, from which this hymn tune is taken, Beethoven was totally deaf. One of the soloist had to turn him around so he could see the wild applause and hat-waving of the enthusiastic audience. He died March 26, 1827.",

    "yearWritten": 1739,
    "historicalContext": "Erik Routley, recognized as probably the foremost hymnologist of the twentieth century, wrote this text for this tune. (There are no other tunes in this unusual meter, although there are some in 9.8.9.8. in a different rhythm.) The words are a paraphrase of Psalm 98.\n\nBorn in Brighton, England, on October 31, 1917, Routley went at age 18 to study classics at Magdalen College, Oxford University. Further work at Mansfield college led to the M.A. in 1943 and B.D. in 1946. The thesis for this latter degree was later published as The Church and Music, 1950. When he earned a PhD. In 1952, once again the excellence of his thesis warranted publication as The Music of Christian Hymnody, 1957. He chose to completely rewrite this work as his “final statement in the matter,” and published it in 1981 as The Music of Christian Hymns, a most comprehensive and perceptive survey of the whole range of music and hymns from the lainsong of the Middle Ages down to the present.\n\nRoutley’s first pastorate was the Congregational church of Wednesbury. During this time he served as editor for Congregational praise, 1951, and married Margaret Scott, a violinist. For 11 years, 1948 to 1959, he was a lecturer, chaplain, director of music and librarian at Mansfield College. This period saw the writing of nine more books, mostly about hymns and church music, and the beginning of a 27-year stint as editor of the Bulletin of the British Hymn Society. Returning to pastoral work in 1959, he went to the Augustine-Bristo Church in Edinburgh, Scotland. While he was there, 13 more books flowed from his fertile mind and prolific pen, including his most successful one, Hymns Today and Tomorrow, 1964.\n\nRoutley made two tours of the United States, in 1062 and 1966, out of which grew two more books, Words, Music, and the Church, and Music Leadership in the Church, both published by Abingdon. He visited this country eight more times before making it his permanent home.\n\nFor a time he was pastor at St. James Church, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, where he was involved with the production of two hymnals, Hymns for Celebration, 1974 and Cantate Domino, 1974. He was elected president of the Congregational church in England and Wales for the year 1970-1971.\n\nIn 1975 he accepted a call to Princeton Theological Seminary, but after a few months moved over to become professor of church music at Westminster Choir College, Princeton, New Jersey. After 1978 he was also director of chapel, which he characterized as an “unfairly ideal situation” (The Hymn, 1981). Using his vast knowledge of hymnic repertoire and consummate skill as a communicator, he led the gifted music students in chapel worship services that were creative and memorable. He once told his class in hymnology, “I am more interested in the people who sing the hymns than in the hymns themselves, and you will never do any good if you are interested only in hymns. You must be interested in people.” As a leader of congregational song, he always took seriously the potential of a gathered group of people to sing with musical sensitivity.\n\nWhile at Princeton he edited Westminster Praise, 1976, a supplement for the chapel, and Ecumenical Praise, 1979, and was a consultant for a new hymnal for the Reformed Church in America, Rejoice in the Lord, 1984.\n\nHistorians will no doubt regard Routley as the most dominant influence on twentieth-century church music. He died at Nashville, Tennessee, on October 8, 1982.\n\nHis other contributions to SDAH are: No. 356, “All Who Love and Serve Your City,” and No. 571, SHARPTHORNE, for “What Does the Lord Require?”\n\nRENDEZ A DIEU (Render to God) is one of those strong, singable tunes that came from the genius of Louis Bourgeois (see SDAH 22)  and his work on the French Genevan Psalter, 1551. It was first published with Psalm 118 in La Forme des Prieres, Strasburg–the date is variously given as 1542, 1543, 1544, and 1545. Bourgeois either adapted it from an older melody or composed it himself.\n\nClaude Goudimel (c. 1505-1572) was born in Besancon, France, he first appeared as a composer in Paris about 1549. He lived among the Hugenots at Metz and died in the massacre of those faithful ones at Lyons, August 27, 1572. His chief contribution to the music of Protestantism was his harmonizations appearing in the Genevan Psalter (see also SDAH 22). For a hymnal that contains 28 of Goudimel’s harmonizations and 32 texts from various editions of the Genevan Psalter, see Hymnal for Colleges and Schools, edited by E. Harold Geer, 1956.Russell Schulz-Widmar was born July 29, 1944, at Harvard, Illinois, to immigrant parents. He learned to love good hymn singing at St. John’s Lutheran Church, Hebron, Illinois. He attended Valparaiso University, Valparaiso, Indiana, and earned the Master of Sacred Music at the School of Sacred Music, Union Theological Seminary, New York City. His Doctor of Musical Arts is from the University of Texas at Austin. He served on the editorial boards for a number of recent hymnals and was the chairman of the music committee for the Episcopal Hymnal 1982,  which was published in 1985. He has written articles and reviews for The Hymn, Journal of the Hymn Society of America. At this writing (1986) he is adjunct associate professor of church music at the Episcopal Theological Seminary, visiting lecturer in church music at the Presbyterian Theological Seminary, and, with his wife, joint director of music at the United Methodist church, all in Austin, Texas. He wrote to the editors of SDAH, “I am delighted you’re using my adaptation of RENDEZ A DIEU and am especially pleased that I  appear on the same page with Erik Routley!”",

Since 1977 she has been teacher in the School of Church Music at Greifswald, where her brother is cantor and leader. The English translation of her hymn was made by the Hymnal Committee in session, and a second stanza was added.\n\nAlfred Stier (1880-1967) was born in Greiz, Thuringia, Germany; he studied sacred music in Leipzig, 1903. He was cantorin Limbach, Saxony, 1904, and in 1911 in Dresden. In 1933 he became musical director for the state church in Saxony. From 1948 he was vocal music leader for Saxony-Anholt in Ilensburg, East Germany. He did considerable work as a composer of church music and was much in demand as a leader for song festivals. O. Sohngen, who knew him, said, “In the person of Alfred Stier the evangelical [Lutheran] church gained an original cantor, who discovered anew the power and potential of singing and who dedicated his life to the service of this concept.” Three of his canons and three melodies are in the SDA German hymnal of 1983.\n\nThe accompanist may play either of the scores for the duration of the canon, which was arranged by Melvin West.",

She was the elder daughter of a timber merchant who was also an unsalaried Baptist minister.  Because of an accident in childhood, she was an invalid all her days, and suffered extreme sorrow when her fiancé was drowned on the eve of her wedding. She was devoutly consecrated to God, however. She manifested her poetic talent at an early age but did not publish until prevailed upon in 1760, when two volumes of poetry appeared. In all, she wrote 144 hymns, 34 psalms, and 30 short poems, using the pen name Theodosia. She died at Broughton on November 11, 1778.\n\nThe tune EL KADER WAS WITH THIS TEXT IN THE 1869 SDA hymnal Hymns and Tunes, and in subsequent SDA hymnals. But it has not been found in any of the standard current hymnals of other churches.",

    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": 1561,
    "historicalContext": "This hymn is a metrical version by William Kethe of Psalm 100. It keeps as close as possible to the actual words of the psalm, transposing the order to preserve the rhyme, and using synonyms at times to maintain the meter and accent. This practice often produced quaint English and led the way to paraphrases, as for example in SDAH 82, which carries the ideas of Psalm 100 but in quite different words. The italicized phrases in the following quotation are actually used in the hymn: “Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands.... Come before his presence with singing. Know ye that the Lord he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise:...  bless his name. For the Lord is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.”\n\nWilliam Kethe, whose birthdate is unknown, is thought to have been a native of Scotland. He became a minister of the Presbyterian Church and fled his country during the religious persecution under Queen Mary. He found refuge with John Huss and John Knox in Geneva, and is noted as being an exile in Frankfort in 1555 and in Geneva in 1557, and he visited exiles in 1558. He remained in Geneva for a time after Mary’s death and was one of the scholars who prepared the English translation of the Geneva Bible in 1560. In the Anglo-Genevan Psalter of 1561 there were 25 metrical versions of the Psalms by Kethe, this hymn being one of them. He returned to England and in 1563 was chaplain to the armed forces. He was appointed as one of the rectors at Child Okeford, a small village five miles northwest of Blandford Forum in Dorset. He served here from 1561 to 1593 and wrote religious and secular ballads. He died in Dorset, probably at Child Okeford, in 1594.\n\nThe tune OLD HUNDREDTH, used also for SDAH 695, and written entirely in quarter notes for SDAH 694, is so named because it was the tune set for Psalm 100 in the Sternhold and Hopkins (1562) version of metrical psalms. This was called the “Old Version” when Tate and Brady produced a “New” version in 1696. The tune appears in a Huguenot psalter compiled by Guillaume Franc (died 1570) and published in Geneva in 1551 (hence its name, Genevan Psalter), where it is set to Psalm 134. It was adopted by Louis Burgeois (c. 1510-c. 1561), who was born in Paris but went to join  John Calvin in Geneva in 1541. There he was choirmaster of St. Pierre and St. Gervais churches, and in 1545 master of the choristers. He was granted French citizenship in 1547 in view of his musical contributions and also for his teaching of the children. He was the musical editor of the first French psalter of 1542 and prepared twopsalters in 1547, which carried harmonies. This offended Calvin, who permitted the singing of the melody only in the Reformed churches, and caused Bourgeois to leave Geneva in 1552. The latter’s Genevan Psalter, printed in 1551, had led to his imprisonment, though only for a day, for altering some tunes without authority. He lived in Lyon, and by 1560 in Paris again, but after 1561 no more is heard of him. He is remembered for arranging and preserving some of the fine tunes still in use today. He altered some secular melodies, adapted German psalm tunes, and stimulated congregational singing in Geneva.",

    "yearWritten": 1848,
    "historicalContext": "This poem was written in 1848 by Oliver Wendell Holmes and published as a Sunday Hymn in the Atlantic Monthly in December, 1859. Homes had founded this magazine in 1857 and  became famous for, among other things, his books entitled Over the Teacups, The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table, and The Professor at the Breakfast Table. This hymn occurs at the end of his essays in the latter book, and is preceded by the following introduction: “Thanks to all those friends who from time to time have sent their messages of kindly recognition and fellow-feeling. Peace to all such as may have been vexed in spirit by any utterance the pages have repeated. They will doubtless forget the moment the difference in the lines of truth we look at through our human prisms, and join in singing (inwardly) this hymn to the Source of the light we all need to lead us, and the warmth which can make us all brothers.”\n\nHolmes was born on August 29, 1809, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and graduated from Harvard in 1829. He was a brilliant lecturer, teacher, and writer, becoming a leading literary figure in the United States. Appointed professor of anatomy and physiology at Harvard in 1847, he retained that post for 35 years. He was a Unitarian, though his hymn is acceptable to Trinitarians. He died at Cambridge, Massachusetts, on October 7, 1894.\n\nThe tune PARK STREET, which is also used for SDAH 393, “Lord of the Sabbath,” probably obtains its name from the Congregational church in Park Street, Boston, which was an old Puritan meetinghouse and a stronghold of orthodoxy. The music is an arrangement of a composition in 1810 by Frederick Marco Antonio Venua (1788-1872), a member of the Royal Society of Musicians in England. It was introduced into church music in 1820 in a hymnal compiled by the Handel and Haydn Society of Boston, Massachusetts.",

    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": 1978,
    "historicalContext": "This is considered the “Queen of the Chorales”  (“Wake, Awake,” SDAH 210, being the “King”). Both words and music were written by Philip Nicolai and included in his Freuden Spiegel (Mirror of Joy), 1599. The opening letters of the original seven stanzas formed an acrostic on the name of one of his students, Wilhelm Ernst, Graf und Herr zu Waldeck. Its title, “A Spiritual bridal song of the believing soul, concerning her heavenly Bridegroom, founded in the forty-fifth psalm of the prophet David,” was actually prophetic, for it became so popular at weddings in Germany that it was almost indispensable.\n\nIn Songs of Praise Discussed, Percy Dearmer recounts how the text was written: “Nicolai, during the same pestilence that inspired ‘Wake, Awake’ [SDAH 210], sat one morning in great distress, thinking of the misery around him, when his heart suddenly rose up to God, and he wrote this hymn, forgetting his noonday meal, and working on till he had finished it in the late afternoon.” In 1768 J. A. Schlegel completely rewrote the text; most of the English translation used in SDAH was prepared by the InterLutheran Commission on Worship for use in Lutheran Book of Worship, 1978.\n\nThe tune WIE SCHON LEUCHTET (How Beautiful Shines) gets its name from the first words of Schlegel’s rewrite, and was published in Nicolai’s above-mentioned book. The tune also became famous and was heard on chimes in many German cities. It is believed that Nicolai may have merely rewritten an earlier tune, much of which is the same, found in Wolff Kophel’s Psalter, 1538. However, the deft touch he added — the four half notes where the text now reads “Lowly, holy” — was a definite factor in escalating the music to favor.\n\nThe great J. S. Bach (see Biographies) loved the tune so well that he based his Cantata No. 1 on it; he used the melody again in Cantata 36, 37, 49, 61, and 172. The harmonization in SDAH is adopted from the final chorus of Cantata No. 1 (1740) as found in the Episcopal Hymnal 1940. Bach also included this magnificent tune in his Choralgesänge, and composed an organ prelude around it. For the fascinating story of the more than 400 “Bach chorals,” see Charles Sanford Terry’s The Four -Part Chorals of J. S. Bach, with the German text of the hymns and English translations, 1929, 1964.\n\nThe son of a Lutheran pastor, Nicolai was born on August 10, 1556, at Mengeringhausen, Waldeck, Germany. After study at the University of Erfurt (1575) and Wittenberg University (1576-1579), he earned the D.D. degree in 1594. From 1579 to 1583 he assisted his father in the hometown church. Then he became pastor at Herdecke, from where the Catholic town council finally drove him away. After serving in several Lutheran churches in Germany, he served his final post at Hamburg (1601 to 1608), where he was a renowned and respected preacher and an influential pillar of the church. During his tenure at Unna, Westphalia, in 1597, the plague took many lives in that city, and he published Freuden Spiegel.  The preface gives his purpose for the book: “To leave behind me (if God should call me from this world) as a token of my peaceful, joyful departure, or (if God should spare me in good health) to comfort other sufferers whom He should also visit with the pestilence.”\n\nNicolai died at Hamburg October 26, 1608. Much of his ministry was clouded with controversy of one kind or another, including disagreement with the Calvinists over the true meaning of the Lord’s Supper. But the conflicts are long forgotten — and these two great hymns inspired by a pestilence remain vital and alive for our rich blessing.",

For notes on Scotish Psalter, see SDAH 62.\n\nThe tune ST. MAGNUS was named after the Church of St. Magnus the martyr near old London Bridge. William Riley gave it this name in his Parochial Harmony, 1758, where many previously unnamed tunes were named after London churches. The tune first appeared in Henry Playfortd’s second edition of Divine Companion, set to Psalm in 117.\n\nJeremiah Clarke was born about 1669 in London; he served in the boys’ choir in the Chapel Royal under John Blow. From 1692 to 1695 he was organist of Winchester College. Then he took Blow’s place at St. Paul’s Cathedral, London, which had just been completed by Christofer Wren and contained a new organ built by Father Smith. Clarke was Queen Anne’s music master, composing some harpsichord pieces for her.  With William Croft (see SDAH 103) in 1700 he was appointed Gentleman of the Chapel Royal and organist there. He was a prolific and versatile musician, writing choral, instrumental, organ, and solo music for the stage. The popular trumpet tune and trumpet voluntary, once thought to be Purcell’s, are now recognized to be Clarke’s. Unfortunately, at the age of about 38, as the result of a disappointment in love he took his own life on December 1, 1707, in the courtyard of St. Paul’s.\n\nFor an alternate harmonization of this tune, see SDAH 199. Clarke’s other tune in SDAH is No. 644, BISHOPTHORPE.",

    "author": "Henry Williams Baker",
    "authorBirthDeath": "1821–1877",
    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": 1861,
    "historicalContext": "This hymn, as contrasted with the previous one, is a paraphrase rather than a metrical version. While using the thought and indeed some of the actual words of the psalm, it incorporates other ideas to make a better flowing poem. It actually draws from two psalms, Psalms 148 and 150.\n\nHenry W. Baker was born in Vauxhall, London, on May 27, 1821. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and in 1844 was ordained to the ministry of the Church of England. Most pastors move every few years, but he served at Monkland near Leominster, Herefordshire, for his entire career–33 years. In the year 1851, at age 30, he succeeded to the baronetcy (a degree of honor just below a baron but above a knight, and honored with the title “Sir”. Believing firmly in celibacy for God’s ministers, he never married.\n\nOne of his greatest contributions to hymnody was his guiding force in the production of the first edition of Hymns Ancient and Modern, 1861. He was the first chairman, editor, and composer of a number of hymn tunes for this record-breaking volume. It sold 60 million copies between 1861 and 1912; its success still continues in the sale of the 1962 revision. (Baker remained chairman of the committee on revisions of this hymnal for 20 years.This praise hymn was written especially for the 1875 edition, of which he was editor. He also translated stanzas 2 and 3 of SDAH No. 116, “Of the Father’s Love Begotten,” and his paraphrase of Psalm 23 is SDAH 197.\n\nThe composer of LAUDATE DOMINUM (Praise the Lord) was another “Sir,” the honor of knighthood having been conferred upon Charles Hubert Hastings Parry in 1898 at age 50, and a baronetcy, five years later. A man of almost limitless interests, he was squire, magistrate, author, amateur scientist, teacher, administrator, composer, organist, pianist, diarist, playgoer and critic, motorist, yachtsman, and accomplished sportsman in many fields. Born February 27, 1848, at Bournemouth, England, he inherited at least some of this varied talent for his inventor-artist father.While being educated at Eton and Oxford, Parry was a leader in music and sports. His father objected to a career in music, so for three years young Parry worked at Lloyd’s. But he did not like the work–his first love was music. From 1883 to 1894 he lectured in composition and musical history at the Royal College of Music, and held the position of choragus at Oxford (a titular functionary at Oxford who derived his name from the leader of the chorus in the ancient Greek drama). His books, The Art of Music, The Music of the Seventeenth Century (In The Oxford History of Music), Style in Musical Art, J. S. Bach, and College Addresses, are considered high-quality literary  works. In his time he was perhaps the leading musical force in England. Honorary doctorates were conferred upon him by Cambridge, Oxford, Dublin, and Durhan universities. Parry was not a churchman, but he is mostly remembered for his music with religious words. In his anthem, “Hear My Words,” 1894, instead of ending with the conventional fugal chorus, he concludes with a setting for Baker’s hymn, “O Praise Ye the Lord.” Much later (1916) it was printed by itself as the hymn tune LAUDATE DOMINUM and has been recognized as a first-class congregational hymn ever since. It first appeared in a hymnbook with this text in the revised Church Hymnary, 1920. Most people who have tall clocks will recognize its opening melody as being derived from the Westminster Chime. Parry died on October 7, 1918, at Rustington (see SDAH 636), a small seaside town on the Sussex coast where he spent the later part of his life.",

    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": 1867,
    "historicalContext": "This hymn is based on 1 Timothy 1:17: “Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever.”\n\nThe prevailing metaphor is light–light so glorious that it obscures the object of one’s praise. Albert Bailey calls it an “attempt to express the inexpressible.” The poem first appeared in Smith’s Hymns of Christ and the Christian Life, 1867, and, after the author made some changes, in Horder’s Congregational Hymns, 1884. Julian describes Smith’s hymns as “vigorous in thought and rich in expression.”\n\nWalter Chalmers Smith was born December 5, 1824, at Aberdeen, Scotland, and educated at the grammar school and university of that city. After studying theology at Edinburgh, he was ordained pastor of the Scottish church on Chadwell Street, Islington, London, in 1850. After several other pastorates, in 1876 he was appointed minister of the Free High Church, Edinburgh. In 1893 he was moderator of the Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland (the beginnings of the Presbyterian Church). A book of his poetry, Poetical Works, was published in 1902. He said that writing poetry was for him, a welcome relief from the heavy burdens of being a busy pastor. He died September 20, 1908, at Kinbach, Perthshire.ST. DENIO, also known as JOANNA and PALESTRINA, is from a Welsh folk song, “A Hundred Years from Now.” The melody was also associated with another song about cuckoo. The first time it was used as a hymn tune was in Caniadau y Cyssegr, a book of praise edited by John Roberts in 1839. It was introduced to England by Ralph Vaughan William as a hymn tune in the English Hymnal, 1906. He also used this tune in the second movement of his Household Quartet: Three Preludes on Welsh Hymn Tunes, 1944. The melody is easy to learn and sing because it follows the notes of the primary chords.",

    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": 1974,
    "historicalContext": "The British hymnologist John Wilson (see SDAH 397) asked Fred Pratt Green (1903-; see Biographies) to write a new hymn poem for the tune CHILSWELL, by Gustav Holst (see SDAH 224). So he wrote this hymn about singers singing, based on Psalm 118:14, RSV: “The Lord is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation.” Erik Routley published it in Westminster Praise, 1976, a supplement for the use of the students at Westminster Choir College, Princeton, New Jersey. As printed by Hope Publishing Company in The Hymns and Ballads of Fred Pratt Green, 1982, the second line of stanza 3 reads “Who praises God the wrath of man disowns.” In order to include everyone, this was changed to “Who praises God our human wrath disowns.” In the final stanza, the author goes beyond the usual creativity and says, “God is our Silence when no songs are sung,” recognizing the times when we might be emotionally overcome that singing is impossible. Then faith carries us through the period of silence until  we can again find the voice of praise.\n\nThe tune OLD 124TH (so called because it is the setting of the metrical version of Psalm 124) is one of the legacies from the Genevan Psalter, 1551, as compiled by Louis Bourgeois, born about 1510. Bourgeois was a follower of John Calvin in Genevan Switzerland, and was in complete charge of the music for the psalters there from about 1541 to 1557. When he arrived, they had a psalter with some 30 tunes. As a result of his genius at finding appropriate tunes and arranging them in four-part harmony, and in composing original tunes, the psalter had 85 when he left. All was not easy for Bourgeois under Calvin’s stern discipline. He experienced the gamut from enjoying full citizen’s rights and exemption from serving on duty, to being jailed for making unauthorized changes in some of the tunes! After Bourgeois was scolded, Calvin secured his release. The alterations that caused his arrest were later officially sanctioned. However, he was unable to get the approval of the Genevan authorities to introduce part-singing in public worship, so he returned to Paris where he could have more freedom. At this point he seemed to vanish from sight, as nothing more is known of his life.\n\nDr. Robert Bridges says of him, “Historians who wish to give a true philosophical account of Calvin’s influence at Geneva ought probably to refer a great part of it to the enthusiasm attendant on the singing of Bourgeois’ melodies.” Erik Routley (se SDAH 13) acclaims these Genevan Psalter tunes to be the “fountainhead of the whole tradition of English and Scottish hymnody.”Other tunes from the Genevan Psalter are: OLD HUNDREDTH, SDAH 16 and 695, and RENDEZ A DIEU, SDAH 13, which Bourgeois wrote for La Forme des Prieres, 1545, commonly known as the first “Genevan Psalter” and published in Strasburg.",

    "historicalContext": "In the Oxford Book of Carols, 1928, labeled “Winter,” this text and tune are presented with the note “Words based on the Welsh New Year’s Eve secular Carol, NOS GALAN. On New Year’s Eve or Day, stanza 3, lines 1 and 5 may be changed to ‘Now we all the New Year sharing.’”\n\nAlan Luff, secretary of the Hymn Society of Great Britain and Ireland and an authority on Welsh hymns, gives us the following about this carol: “GALAN is from ‘calan,’ which is from the Latin ‘calends,’ the first of the month. Its meaning has become narrowed down until it refers to New Year’s Day. NOS means night or eve, thus ‘New Year’s Eve’ is right.... Please notice that the usual Welsh words are relatively modern and the English words normally used are by no means a translation. The tune may be old, but it has come to us through the harp tradition so that it is now a very straight major mode tune. Many of these tunes either were instrumental melodies or lost their words [e.g., “All Through the Night,” “David of the White Rock”] The true vocal carol tradition in Welsh also was very free in writing new words–in fact, there are no ‘original’ words.”\n\nKatherine Emily Roberts was born in 1877 at Leicester, England. She was educated privately at Peterborough and studied singing in London and Paris, looking forward to a professional career. In 1913 she married R.E. Roberts, and in 1933 was the organizing secretary to the Rutland Rural Community Council. She wrote a book of three historical pageants; several plays, and, with her husband, a history of Peterborough and Carol Stories, 1923.\n\nThis paraphrase of the Welsh carol was printed in the Oxford Book of Carols, 1928. In the early printings of SDAH, the birth and death dates for Katherine Roberts are incorrectly given as 1879-1953. The correct dates are 1877-1962, at Ashford, in Middlesex.\n\nMozart liked this melody well enough to use it in duet for violin and piano composed around the year 1700. The arrangement by Wayne Hooper (1920-    ).",

    "historicalContext": "In his Music of Christian Hymns, Erik Routley says: “Carter emerged in the 1960s as a new kind of folksinger who successfully built a bridge between the ‘folk underground’ and that orthodox society with which it was at odds. Most of his tunes are true folk music in that you feel that they were there before he discovered them. They cannot be sung  to any words but his own, so they are not true hymn tunes, but they have just that of innocent originality that makes some of them authentic folk music; perhaps the most gracious of them is EVERY STAR.”\n\nSydney Bertram Carter was born May 6, 1915, at Camden Town, London, and studied at Balliol College, Oxford. After a time as a schoolmaster, he served during World War II with the Friends Ambulance Unit in the Middle East and Greece. He has taught and lectured for the British Council in Norway, Spain, Poland, and Germany. In radio and television work, he has done a large volume of writing scripts for the British Broadcasting Company, including serials teaching foreign languages.\n\nIt was his dissatisfaction with the unchangeable formality of church services that led him to start writing sacred texts and tunes for informal gatherings of people. Many of his songs were critical of the established church and protested what he felt was a lack of awareness of what was going on in the real world. Even though he wrote most of them as temporary throwaway music, their quality has found for many of them a place in hymnals around the world. A number of collections have been published, including Green Print for Song, 1963; Nine Songs or Ballads, 1964; Ten New Songs; Nothing Fixed or Final;  and Sydney Carter in the Present Tense, 1969. Donald Swann and James Minchin are among several musicians who have harmonized Carter’s tunes; he does not do that himself.",

    "historicalContext": "Henry Francis Lyte (1793-1847; see SDAH 4), Anglican vicar of Lower Brixham, Devon, is best known as the author of “Abide With Me,” SDAH 50.  In this hymn, written in 1835 and published in his Spirit of the Psalms, he has further shown his poetic gift in a very free paraphrase of Psalm 150. This psalm has six verses, each containing the word praise twice, with the exception of the first verse, which uses this word three times. The stanza omitted is is:\n\nStrings and voices, hands and hearts, Alleluia!\n  In the concert bear your parts; Alleluia!\nAll that breath, your Lord adore, Alleluia!\n  Praise Him, praise Him evermore! Alleluia!\n\nThe alleluias (a form of hallelujah, the Hebrew for “Praise ye Jehovah ”) were added as an accommodation to fit the tune. Lyte, whose poems and hymns were mostly on the sad side, has caught the exultant spirit of the psalmist in his last verse of the book of Psalms: “Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord” (Psalms 150:6).\n\nLyte also wrote SDAH 4, “Praise, My soul, the King of Heaven” SDAH 50, “Abide With Me”; and SDAH 325, “Jesus, I My Cross Have Taken.”\n\nLLANFAIR is dated 1817 in the composer’s manuscript book, where he named it BETHEL… It was first published in Joseph Parry’s Peroriaeth Hyfryd, 1837, and later in the English Hymnal, 1906, where it was matched with Wesley’s “Hail the Day That Sees Him Rise” (see SDAH 176). The form is AABA, one of the easiest to learn and remember, as the score of the melody is repeated in scores 2 and 4. Llan means church and fair refers to Mary, thus “The Church of St. May.” In McCutchan’s Hymn Tune Names, he tells how the first four letters “Llan” constitute the prefix of some 450 place names in Wales. Llanfair is the abbreviation of a village in Montgomery County whose name is the word in any language — 58 letters: “Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch”! It means “Church of St. Mary in a hallow of white hazel near the rapid whirlpool of the Church of St. Tysillio by the red cave.” The words in italic are an exact translation of the long string of Welsh words. The village is on the isle of Anglesey, just across the Menai Strait from the town of Bangor.\n\nNot much is known about the composer, Robert Williams (c. 1781-1821), except that he was a blind basketmaker who lived on the isle of Anglesey in the northern part of Wales. He was evidently a most gifted natural musician, a good singer who could write down a tune after hearing it only once.The arrangement was for ra Welsh hymnbook of 1837 by John Roberts, who was born December 22, 1822, near the Welsh City of Aberystwyth. A young prodigy, Robert directed a choir at 14 and was a schoolmaster at age 16! After serving as assistant editor of Amserau, the most influential Welsh paper of that time, he was ordained a Calvinistic Methodist minister in 1859. He worked as a pastor in northern Wales, and founded the famous Welsh singing festival “Cymanfau Ganu,” which is still held. He published an important hymnal, edited a monthly music magazine and a publication for children, and prepared a Welsh translation of a collection of hymns by D. L. Moody and Ira D. Sankey in 1874. He died May 6, 1877.",

    "historicalContext": "The text comes from Psalms 148, which begins “Praise ye the Lord. Praise ye the Lord from the heavens: praise him in the heights. Praise ye him all his angels: praise ye him all his hosts.”\n\nK. L. Parry, in Companion to Congregational Praise, 1953, says the hymn was first found on a four-paged sheet pasted at the end of some copies of the music edition of Psalm, Hymns, and Anthems of the Founding Hospital, London, 1796. This sheet had the title “Hymns of Praise. For Founding Apprentices Attending Divine Service to Return Thanks.” It was customary in the latter part of the eighteenth century for those in charitable institutions to be regularly involved in hymn singing.\n\nHymnologist John Julian clears up the apparent discrepancy in the dates of 1796 and 1801, the later being the date of a printing of the word-only edition. It was printed several times in other hymnbooks before Osler’s final stanza was added in 1853 in Cooke and Dentons’s Church Hymnal, which they picked up from Hall’s Mitre Book, 1836.\n\nEdward Osler was born January 30, 1798, at Falmouth, Cornwall, England, and took the medical course at Guy’s Hospital, London. From 1819 to 1825 he was the house surgeon at the Swansea (Wales) Infirmary; then he joined the Royal Navy as a surgeon. Changing to literary pursuits, he moved to London and devoted the rest of his life to writing, as editor of the Royal Cornwall Gazette. He died March 7, 1863. He wrote 50 hymns and 15 psalm versions for the Mitre Hymn Book, noted above. His other hymns in SDAH is No. 405, “O God, Unseen, Yet Ever Near.”AN DIE FREUDE (To Joy) is by an unknown composer; it was used as a setting for the German poet Schiller’s Hymn to Joy, 1799. In the Foundling Hospital Collection referred to above, “Praise the Lord, Ye Heavens Adore Him” was listed to be sung with “Music by Haydn.” This music is very much in the style of Haydn, but there is no proof that he wrote it.",

    "author": "Edward H. Plumptre",
    "authorBirthDeath": "1821–1891",
    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": 1865,
    "historicalContext": "These words were written by Edward Hayes Plumptre in 1865 especially for the choir festival in Peterborough Cathedral. They were first sung there to a tune by William Henry Monk (see SDAH 50). The theme was taken from Psalm 20:5: “We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God will set up our banners,” and amplified to suit the special occasion. The length of time occupied in a choir festival procession in a large cathedral necessitates a long hymn. Consequently, there were originally 11 stanzas. The complete text of the hymn shows that the author has used the processional as a type of the Christian pilgrim’s spiritual march to the New Jerusalem, singing all the way. Other scriptures referred to are: “Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice” (Phil. 4:4); “Both young men...; old men” (Ps. 148:12).\n\nPlumptre was born in Bloomsbury, London, on August 6, 1821, and educated at King’s College, London, and University College, Oxford. He gained his B.A. in 1844, was ordained to the ministry in the Anglican Church in 1846, and received his M.A. in 1847. He was then appointed as chaplain at King’s College. During his occupancy there, which lasted until 1868, he was first professor of pastoral theology and then of New Testament exegesis. He was also prebendary at St. Paul’s Cathedral, and special lecturer at Oxford on several occasions. In 1869 he was appointed as rector of Pluckley, a small town in Kent. In 1873 he was vicar of Bickley, a village also in Kent, and then in 1881 was appointed dean of Wells Cathedral in Somerset. He was a noted theologian and preacher, and wrote copiously on history, the classics, divinity, and biography. He wrote several volumes of verse and hymns–many for special occasions, and some translated from Latin. The University of Glasgow honored him with a D.D. degree in 1875. He died at Wells on February 1, 1891. He also wrote SDAH 351, “Thy Hand, O God Has Guided.”The tune MARION was composed in 1883 by Arthur Henry Messiter and named for his mother, Marrion. It is unusual in that it undergoes several changes of key in such a short hymn: F major, D minor, C major, B-flat major, D major, and back to F major again. Messiter was born in Frome, Somerset, on April 1, 1834, and from ages 17 to 21 was apprenticed to a musician. Then he studied piano and voice privately and became a piano teacher. He emigrated to the United States in his late 20s and was a choir member of the Trinity Episcopal Church in New York City. Next, he was organist at St. Mark’s, Philadelphia, and professor of music at the Female College in Poultney, Vermont. Returning to Philadelphia, he was the organist at three churches successively. In 1866 he was appointed choir leader and organist at Trinity Episcopal Church in New York City and retired in 1897. He wrote several anthems, edited a psalter, and after retirement in 1906, wrote The History of the Choir and Music of Trinity Church. He died in New York City on July 2, 1916.",

    "historicalContext": "Steuart Wilson wrote these words especially for the music of the French carol “Quelle est cette odeur agreable?” or “What is This Lovely Fragrance?” Printed in the Oxford Book of Carols, 1928, it has not found its way into very many hymnbooks.\n\nChristmas is usually thought of as the season for carols. Actually, there are carols for every season of the year and for many special occasions. This one seems to have been written with spring in mind, when nature is responding again to God’s call to new life and bloom and growth. The hymn is also eminently suited for a congregation to sing at the marriage service.\n\nJ. Stewart Wilson was born on July 22, 1889, in Clifton, Bristol, England, and was educated at Winchester College and King’s College, Cambridge. After active service in World War I, he became well known as a concert singer, appearing in large festivals in Britain, Australia, and America. He edited and published English translations of several collections of the songs of Schubert, Schuman, and Brahms. He died at Petersfield, Hampshire, on December 18, 1966.\n\nFRAGRANCE (also called CAROL OF BEAUTY) has been well known in England since it was borrowed from the French carol above and used as the setting of a church in Gay’s Begar’s Opera, 1728. The natural flowing beauty of this melody will richly reward those who take the time to learn it.\n\nThe arrangement in SDAH is from the Oxford Book of Carols, arranged by Martin Show (1876-1958; see Biographies), whom Erik Routley calls “that remarkable apostle of English excellence.”",

    "yearWritten": 1864,
    "historicalContext": "This hymn of nine stanzas was in Schutz’s Christliches Gedenkbüchlein (Christian Commemorative Booklet), published in 1675 at Frankfurt am Main, Germany. It was headed “Hymn of Thanksgiving” and was based on Deuteronomy 32:3, “Because I will publish the name of the Lord: ascribe ye greatness unto our God.”\n\nFrances Cox translated eight of the stanzas into English, and it was printed in her Hymns From the German, 1864. Ever since then it has been a treasured part of the Lutheran song tradition.\n\nJohann Jacob Schutz was born September 7, 1640, at Frankfurt am Main, Germany. He studied law and practiced all of his life in his hometown. He was highly respected as a counselor, and for His deep sense of piety. Influenced by Philipp Spener and Johann Petersen, he left the Lutherans and became a Separatist. In 1683 he joined with others in the Frankfurt Company, which purchased land in Germantown, Pennsylvania, from William Penn. He died at Frankfurt on May 22, 1690.\n\nFrances Elizabeth Cox was born on May 10, 1812, at Oxford, England. She wrote a few poems for magazines before she achieved fame as a translator. Barron C.C.J. Bunsen, ambassador from Germany 1841 to 1854, had compiled an important book of German hymns in 1833 and suggested that she make some of them available in English. She did so, translating and publishing 46 of them in Sacred Hymns From the German, 1841. Later she revised 27 of them and added 29 new ones in Hymns From the German, 1864. She died at Iffley, Oxford, in September 1897.MIT FREUDEN ZART (With Tender, or Fond, Joy), gets its name from the original German text associated with this tune, the translation of which is, “With high delight let us unite.” It is also known as BOHEMIAN BRETHREN, after the followers of John Huss, who fled persecution in Bohemia (Czechoslovakia) and found refuge on the estate of Count Zinzendorf (see SDAH 177) in Saxony, Germany. The hymnbooks of the brethren made free use of adopted folk songs, and this could be from such a source. It is believed that the tune originated in the Middle Ages, and many different versions have found their way into hymnbooks. It is closely related to LASST UNS ERFREUEN (see SDAH 2, 91, 228). It resembles the tune for Psalm 138 in the Genevan Psalter and is similar to a popular French song, Une pastorelle gentille,” printed about 1529. The Bohemian Brethren included it in their Kirkengesaänge (Church Hymns), 1566, and Ralph Vaughan William (see Biographies) introduced it to English congregations in the English Hymnal, 1906.",

    "historicalContext": "This poem by an unknown German author is a versification of a portion of the “Te Deum laudamus” (We Praise Thee, O God), an anonymous, unmetrical Latin hymn that may date to the fourth century. The text can be found in the Hymnal 1940 and other hymnbooks. It was published in the Katholisches Gesangbuch (Catholic Hymnbook), Vienna, 1744, at the request of the Austrian empress, Maria Theresa. Walworth’s translation was included in the Catholic Psalmist, Dublin, 1858.\n\nClarence Augustus Walworth was born May 30, 1820, at Plattsburg, New York. He graduated from Union college and for a time practiced law in Canandaigua and Albany. At first a Presbyterian, he studied for the Episcopalian ministry but joined the Oxford movement and became a Catholic Priest in 1845. He was one of the founders of the Paulist Order in the United States, and from 1866 to his death on September 19, 1900, was rector of St. Mary’s Church, Albany, New York. He wrote a number of hymn translations and paraphrases and several books, including The Oxford Movement in America, 1895.\n\nThe tune GROSSER GOTH (Great God), by an unknown composer, gets its name from the first words of the original German text printed in Katholisches Gesangbuch. There it had a slightly different melody and was in a 6/8 time with a folk song quality. The abbreviated English form of the tune is known as HURSLEY (see SDAH 502, “Son of My Soul.”). Note that the melody proceeds by successive notes of the scale by single steps, with the exception of four uses of the interval of the 3rd.",

    "historicalContext": "Timothy Dudley-Smith (1926-   ) wrote this in 1961 at Vanbrugh Park, Blackheath, England, the first home of his married life. He had just read the first line of “The Song of Mary” (The Magnificat) from a review copy of the New English Bible he had received. It is actually a paraphrase of Luke 1:46-55, where Mary gives praise to God for choosing her to be the mother of the Messiah. In the first 20 years after he wrote it, the hymn found its way into some 40 hymnbooks and collections, becoming by far his most successful. WOODLANDS, by Walter Greatorex, is the most often used tune in these books.\n\nMORESTEAD was composed for the text “Lift Up Your Hearts” in Hymns for Church and School, 1964. Many composers named tunes after a place or person that evoked pleasant memories. In this case, Sydney Watson named his piece after a village through which he used to ride a bicycle on his way to Winchester in the lovely county of Hampshire, England.\n\nWatson was born September 3, 1903, in Denton, Lancashire, England, and educated at Warwick School, the Royal College of Music, and Keble College, Oxford, where he was an organ scholar. The positions he held were music master at Stowe School; precentor of Radley School; organist of New College, Oxford; conductor of Oxford Harmonic Society and Oxford Orchestral Society; master of music at Winchester College; precentor and director of music at Eton College; and organist for the Sheldonian Theater. From 1955 until his retirement in 1970 he served as organist at Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, and conductor of the Oxford Bach Choir and the Oxford Orchestral Society. From his home at Aynho he has served as an examiner for the Associated Board of the Royal School of Music. He holds the D.Mus. From Oxford and is a Fellow of the Royal College of Organist.\n\nThis tune begins with a grand sweep upward on the four notes of the tonic chord and continues in a most engaging way. First time users of this hymn will need a little warning that the second and third lines begin with a rest. See also SDAH 635, where MORESTEAD is used again with “Lord of All Good.”",

    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "This is one of two hymns the SDAH has about music and singing, the other being SDAH 22, “God Is Our Song,” also by Fred Pratt Green (1903-; see Biographies). Stanza 3 recalls Mark 14:26; “And when they had sung an hymn, they went into the mount of Olives.” Stanza 4 reminds us of Psalm 150:3-6.\n\nThe text was written in 1972 at the request of British hymnologist John Wilson (see SDAH 397), who wanted it for use at a festival of praise or a choir anniversary. Wilson wanted to use the tune ENGELBERG, which had been written for the text “For All the Saints” to be in the 1904 edition of Hymns Ancient and Modern. But when Ralph Vaughan Williams’ tune SINE NOMINE (see SDAH 421) came on the scene in 1906, it became the tune for the text. Until the Episcopal Hymnal 1940 used it with “All Praise to Thee,” by F. Bland Tucker, ENGELBERG was in danger of being lost. The tune appeared again in the Lutheran Book of Worship, 1978.\n\nOriginally the first line read “When in man’s music God is glorified.” The change to “our” was made to meet objections to sexist language. The author still feels that the loss of the juxtaposition of “man” and “God” somewhat weakens the line, which he intended to be a sharp contrast between creature and Creator.\n\nIn England, Charles Villiers Stanford was one of the most influential church musicians of his time. Born September 30, 1852, in Dublin, Ireland, he was a child prodigy–at age of 10 one of his compositions was played in the Dublin Royal Theater. Accepted as a choral scholar at Queen’s College, Cambridge, at age 18, he became the organist at Trinity College three years later. There he earned the B.A. in 1874 and the M.A. in 1877.\n\nFor two years (1874 to 1876) he studied in Berlin and Leipzig. Then in 1887 he returned to Cambridge to be professor of music and professor of composition at Royal College of Music, holding both positions until his death in 1924–More than 35 years. For 21 years he directed the Cambridge Musical Society, and for 17, the London Bach Choir. Several of his students turned out to be famous, among them Ralph Vaughan Williams, Gustav Holst, and Walford Davies. He was knighted in 1902. After his death March 29, 1924, his ashes were buried in Westminster Abbey. He composed about 200 works — symphonies, concertos, operas, songs, and choral and organ works — and received honorary doctorates from four universities. He contributed several hymn tunes to the 1904 Hymns Ancient and Modern, about which Erik Routley says, “He packed too much music into his compositions to make them congregationally acceptable. There’s a touch of Irish perverseness in them that is exceedingly attractive to the musical, but that leave ordinary singers gasping.”\n\nENGELBERG  is “through-composed” — that is, the melody has no repeated phrase, but keeps on going with new material. It is challenging, but certainly will be a delight to sing once a little time and effort are invested to learn it.",

    "historicalContext": "Timothy Dudley-Smith (1926-; see Biographies) wrote this text, on the theme of praise and worship, in 1971 at Ruan Minor, the name of a small village in Cornwall on the south coast of England where his family loved to spend summer holidays. It is a paraphrase of portions of Psalm 98. It was first published in Psalm Praise, 1973. Since then it has been included in many hymnbooks in England, New Zealand, and the United States.\n\nRegarding the writing of the tune, David Wilson writes, “ONSLOW SQUARE is one of my favorites among what I have done. The tune was written in 1970, and was one of those that I wrote more or less in one evening, at the organ at St. Paul’s, Onslow Square [South Kensington, London], where I was a curate. It had a huge organ with a powerful tuba stop that balanced the rest of the organ coupled together. I therefore started playing a marchlike accompaniment of shifting chords, and then the tune from the tuba suggested itself, and this is the result. I do have a strong sense of God’s help and inspiration in composition, because I am not formally trained in that field, so the credit is all His.”\n\nWilson was born in 1940 and grew up in noisy, wartime Greenwich, London. He studied botany at Manchester University, 1958-1961; theology at Clare College, Cambridge, 1961-1963; and completed his training for the ministry at Ridley Hall, Cambridge, 1963-1965. All the way through school he sang in choirs and played piano and organ; he began composing music about 1963. Some of his music was in Youth Praise, Volume 1, and he was the editor of Youth Praise, Volume 2, in 1969. In 1973 he was involved in Psalm Praise, metrical version of the Psalms in contemporary music style. His most recent project in hymnody was as chairman of the music for Hymns for Today’s Church, a full-scale hymnbook published by Hoddler and Stoughton in 1982.\n\nOrdained to the Anglican ministry in Southwark Cathedral, 1965, he has served as curate (associate pastor) in Battersea, southwest London, and in South Kensington, London. In 1973, with his wife and two children, he made the move to Leicaster, where he became vicar (pastor). Since the summer of 1984 he has been vicar of St. Mary’s, Osterly Road, Isleworth, Middlesex.\n\nThis lively tune with a judicious use of syncopation should be pleasing to young worshipers and all those who like a “happy” sound that is a little different.\n\nThe name of the tune, ONSLOW SQUARE, was not available at the time of publication of SDAH, so does not appear at the head of the hymn nor in the Index of Tune Names. The meter is one of a kind — 7.7.6.5.8.",

    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "These words are part of a long poem of nine stanzas of eight lines each, written by Joseph Swain. It was first published in Swains’s Redemption, a Poem in Five Parts, 1791.  In his Experimental Essays on Divine Subjects in verse, 1834, it is entitled “A Description of Christ by His Graces and Power. From Solomon’s Song.”\n\nJoseph Swain was born in Bermingham in 1761. His parents died while he was still young, so he was apprenticed to an engraver; he completed his apprenticeship in London under his elder brother. His poetic talent led him into undesirable company, but his conscience was working, and he bought a Bible in 1872. Reading it, he was convinced he should change his careless and frivolous ways, and he began to use his talent by writing hymns for his own use. He heard Dr. Rippon (see SDAH 509) preach as well as others, but decided to follow Rippon and was baptized by him on May 11, 1783. He held prayer and testimony meetings in his own home, and the experience here gained led to his being called to preach on Sundays in Baptist congregations in 1791. Ordained on February 8, 1792, he became the leader of a church of 27 members in Walworth, southeast London. He was so successful that the church building was enlarged three times and the membership increased to more than 200 within four years. He rarely enjoyed good health, and passed to his rest on April 14, 1796. In addition to the two volumes mentioned previously, he also wrote Walworth Hymns, 1792, which contained 129 of his hymns, plus a supplement in 1794 containing 192 hymns.\n\nThe tune BELOVED, or DULCIMER, was composed in 1813 by Freeman Lewis (1780-1859), of Uniontown, Pennsylvania. He was a surveyor as well as a musician. The tune appears to be derived from an old folk song. The melody of the first line is almost identical with that employed by Haydn in his Drum Roll Symphony No. 103 in E-flat major, second movement, andante; one note in the latter is a half step higher. The tune was arranged in 1869 by Hubert Platt Main, born August 17, 1839, the son of a singing schoolteacher. Main became associated with music publishers and helped Philip Philipps (see SDAH 610) compile the Methodist Episcopal Hymn and Tune Book, 1866. He was employed by William B. Bradbury (see Biographies) in 1867 and stayed all his life with this firm, which later became Biglow and Main, and then the Hope Publishing company. Main composed more than 1000 songs, hymn tunes, and anthems, and edited many collections for use in church and Sunday school, both hymnal and gospel songbooks. He died October 7, 1925, at Newark, New Jersey.\n\nHe also arranged SDAH 325 and 621, ELLESDIE, and SDAH 456.",

    "historicalContext": "This hymn was first used in the fourth Finnish hymnal, 1886. And first and only use in America seems to be in the Lutheran Book of Worship, 1798.\n\nJulius Leopold Fredrik Krohn (1835-1888) was a teacher of the Finnish language and literature, University of Helsinki. He was a member of the committee for the above Finnish hymnal, and wrote a number of original hymns and several translations that are used today by the people of Finland. In 1880 he published the first history of Finnish hymnals.\n\nThis translation to English was made by Ernest Edwin Ryden and Toivo Harjunpaa for Laudamus (Let Us Praise), 1963–Hymnal of the Lutheran World federation.\n\nEarnest Ryden was born September 12, 1886, of Sweddish parents in Kansas City. Missouri. Graduating from the Lutheran Augustana College in 1910, he worked for a time as a newspaper editor. He studied for the Lutheran ministry at Augustana Seminary and was ordained in 1914. While there he married a fellow student, Agnes Johnson, an organist at Wakefield, Nebraska. After filing several posts as pastor in New York State, he served 14 years at Gloria Dei Lutheran Church, St. Paul, Minnesota, which became under his leadership one of the largest congregations in the city.\n\nHis versatility led to many positions of responsibility: radio broadcaster of hymnology on station KSTP; president of an organization that built three orphanages; editor of Lutheran Companion from 1934 to 1961, president of the Augustana board of directors; president of the American Lutheran Conference; coeditor of The Hymnal, 1925, of the Augustana Synod, and secretary of the joint commission for the Service Book of Hymnal, 1958. In 1948, Sweden honored him with the Royal Order of the North Star. He died January 1, 1981, in North Grosvenor Dale, Connecticut.\n\nHis scholarship in the study of hymnology is available to all in two books, The Story of Our Hymns, 1935, and The Story of Christian Hymnody. His hymns have been printed in the hymnals of many churches.\n\nToivo K. I. Harjunpaa was born June 2, 1910, at Rauma, Finland; he studied at the University of Helsinki; the University of Abo, Finland; and the University of California at Berkeley. Ordained in 1936, he has served a church near Turku, Finland; as secretary of the Evangelical Student Association; seaman’s chaplain in London, 1938-1945; chaplain to the archbishop of Finland; pastor of St. John’s Lutheran Church, New Bedford Massachusetts, pastor at Shepherd of the Hills Lutheran Church, Berkely; and teacher at Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary. Fluent in Finnish, Swedish, German, and English, he has written many books and lectured widely on theology, worship, hymnology, and the work of the pastor. Recognized as a great leader, he has been called to serve the Lutheran Church in numerous official positions of responsibility.\n\nFINLAND is a traditional Finnish melody about which very little is known. It was used with this text in the Lutheran Book of Worship, 1978, but research has been unable to find it in any other current hymnbook. An easy tune to learn and sing, it has a large number of single steps from one note to another, up or down.",

    "historicalContext": "Here we have a Swedish hymn, translated into Finnish, then into English, but still wedded to a delightful Finnish folk tune! Johan Kahl (1721-1746) was born in Visby on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. A civil servant in Stockholm, Sweden, he joined with the Moravian movement in that part of the country. In 1745 this group published a second edition of a book with 223 religious songs titled Sions Sänger; some 60 of the songs were by this pious young man.\n\nFor some reason, possibly because they were not officially authorized by the state church, his hymns did not find ready acceptance in his homeland, for the Swedish Psalmbook of 1819 included only one of his poems, and the same was true for the Psalmbook of 1937. But the original Sions Sänger was translated into the Finnish language in 1790 and became the favorite songbook of the Pietists in Southern Finland, known as the “Praying People.” Later the same book was used in revivals in other parts of the country, and nine of his hymns, including this one, were printed in the 1938 official hymnbook of the Church of Finland. Its first use in English was the translation from Finnish by Ernest Ryden (1886-1981; see SDAH 37), in the Lutheran Service Book and Hymnal, 1958, which preserved the most unusual irregular form.\n\nThe vigorous minor tune NYT YLÖS SIELUNI (Finnish for Arise, My Soul, Arise) was “found” by two young students, Berndt Nyberg and Ilmari Krohn, who in 1890 were traveling in central Finland listening to and writing down the fascinating folk melodies of the Praying People. An old sexton sang for them this text and tune, which had eventually been used together for many generations. The pair published it in a book titled People’s Gift to the church. From there it was included in the Finnish hymnbook of 1938.\n\nAs arranged by Uriah S. Leopold in the Lutheran Service Book and Hymnal, it was in the key of D minor, with all the leading notes sharped. For SDAH the tunes committee elected to use a recent anthem version, and left all the leading notes natural.",

    "yearWritten": 1719,
    "historicalContext": "This paraphrase of Psalm 5 by Isaac Watts (1674-1748; see Biographies) appeared in his Psalm of David, 1719. There are eight stanzas in the original hymn. Watts added the following note after his hymn: “This psalm begins with the mention of morning prayer, and proceeds to the worship of God in His temple, which inclined me to entitle it “For Lord’s Day Morning.”\n\nRegarding SDAH stanzas 2 and 3, Watts commented, “Where any just occasion is given to make mention of Christ and the Holy Spirit, I refuse it not; and I am persuaded David would not have refused it, had he lived under the gospel, nor St. Paul, had he written a Psalm-Book.” This illustrates the principle Watts had in mind in the full title he gave his book, The Psalms of David Imitated in the Language of the New Testament, and Adapted to the Christian State and Worship.\n\nComparison of the hymn with the psalm will show that stanza 1 and 2 in the SDAH correspond with the first three verses of the psalm, stanza 3 with verse 8, and stanza 4 with verses 11 and 12.\n\nThe tune MEAR is probably by the music engraver Aaron Williams (1731-1776), of Welsh descent, a member of the Scots Church in London, and editor of Williams’ Psalmody, 1770. MEAR appears in an early New England collection of hymn tunes appended to a copy of an edition of an edition of Tate and Brady’s New Version, published in Boston in 1757. It is certainly a shortened version of the tune HOLBORN, which first appeared in 1763 in Williams’ The Universal Psalmist. Another Watts-Wiliams’ combination is SDAH (372), “How Beauteous Are Their Feet.” to the tune ST. THOMAS.",

    "historicalContext": "These words were written in 1866 by Ada Cambridge, who was born November 21, 1844, at St. Germains in Norfolk, England, and appear in her Hymns on the Holy Communion. The title of the hymn is “Fourth Commandment,” and it was intended for Sunday morning, for it expresses the spiritual meaning of the Sabbath (which she identified with the first day of the week) as a day of rest from sin and of peace with God. Originally there were eight stanzas.\n\nIn April 1869 Ada Cambridge married a curate, George Frederick Cross, who was appointed rector on his wedding day; the couple sailed for Australia a month later. She helped her husband by being a district visitor in various parishes of the state of Victoria, where he was stationed. She also wrote Hymns on the Litany and other books. She died July 19, 1926, at Melbourne, Australia.\n\nThe tune ST. GEORGE BOLTON was composed in 1875 by James Walch and commemorates the name of the church in Bolton Lancashire, where he was the church organist at the time. Walch was born on June 21, 1837, in the village of Egerton, near Bolton, Lancanshire. He studied music under his father and then under Henry Smart (see SDAH 119), and in his very early teens was a church organist. He played in both Congregational and Anglican churches and in 1863 was appointed organist for St. George’s church in Bolton. He conducted the Bolton Philharmonic Society from 1874 to 1877. Then he moved to Burrow; he was church organist there and conducted a music business. He wrote other hymn tunes and church music. He died on August 31, 1901 at Llandudno, in North Wales. He also composed SDAH 365, TIDINGS.",

    "translator": "Robert S. Bridges (1844-1930) and others",
    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "Based on Hebrews 1:3, “Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high,” this beautiful morning hymn to Christ, the light of the world, is a prayer for help and guidance through the day. The use of the hymn for lauds (early morning prayers) is found c. A.D. 555 in the rule Aurelian of Arles. The earliest manuscript of this eight-stanza Latin hymn, “Splendor Paternae gloriae” (Splendor of Paternal Glory), dates to about A.D. 700. Scholars attribute this work to Ambrose, bishop of Milan.\n\nLiterally hundreds of poets have been impressed to translate this poem about Christ, the Light. The translation of the first two stanzas in the SDAH, by Robert Bridges (1844-1930; see SDAH 5), was made for his 1899 Yattendon Hymnal, published in England. The third and fourth stanzas are translations of stanzas 7 and 8, but not by Bridges.\n\nAmbrose was born about A.D. 340 at Treves (modern Trier), Germany, amid wealth and power. He was educated at Rome and began practice of law in Milan, Italy. His ability as a speaker led to his appointment as prefect (president) of upper Italy and Milan. In this position he was called upon to preside over the election of a new bishop when Auxentius, an Arian, died in 374. (The Arian controversy over the nature of Christ, denying His oneness with God, was causing riots and bloodshed.) Ambrose’s gravity and calm serenity, as well as his eloquence, seemed to quiet the raging spirits. Tradition says that a child in the crowd cried out, “Ambrose is bishop!” The crowd caught it up and proclaimed him bishop on the spot. He was consecrated eight days later, even though at the time he was only studying for baptism!\n\nHe gave up his considerable private wealth, gave himself to prayer and study, and lived a model life. He accepted no invitations to banquets; he ate dinner only on Saturday, Sunday, and feast days; he preached every Sunday and often in the week; he made himself accessible to the poor; and he showed the constant zeal of a student, together with the wise prudence of a man of importance. (Read the story of his strong stand against idolatry, heresy, and despotism in Duffield’s Latin Hymns, 1889.)\n\nAmbrose realized the power of congregational singing and is credited for bringing in the singing of psalms and hymns after the style of the Eastern churches. His hymns were simple and clear, setting a style known as “Ambrosian,” which was imitated for many centuries. One of his disciples was Saint Augustine, who was deeply moved by the beauty of the singing at Milan and said, “How I wept at thy hymns and canticles, pierced to the quick by the voices of thy melodious church! Those voices flowed into my ears, and the truth distilled into my heart, and thence there streamed forth a devout emotion, and my tears ran down, and happy was I therein” (Confessions 9. 6). Ambrose died April 4, 397.\n\nThe tune GONFALON ROYAL was composed for the text “The royal banners forward go.” Gonfalon is an old Anglo-Norman word that means “banner.” Percy Buck wrote the tune for the boys’ school at Harrow, and its first printing was in Public School Hymn Book, 1919, with “Lord of All Being” (see SDAH 17). Its popularity with children is seen in this story: “When in August 1947 a party of Welsh children were asked in a Children’s Hour broadcast to sing ‘any children’s hymn’ impromptu, it was this tune that they instantly selected” (Erik Routley, Companion to Congregational Praise, 1953).\n\nSir Percy Carter Buck was born March 25, 1871, at West Ham, Essex, England. He was educated at the Royal College of Music under Sir Hubert Parry (see SDAH 20), and at Worcester College, Oxford, where he earned an M.A. in 1894 and a D. Mus. In 1897. He was organist at Wells and Bristol cathedrals and, beginning in 1901, taught music at Harrow School for 26 years.  He also taught at Dublin University and London University. When he retired in 1936, he was knighted. His publications include Acoustics for Musicians, 1918; The Scope of Music, 1924; A History of Music, 1929; Psychology and Music, 1944, and collaboration on Tudor Church Music Series; Oxford History of Music; English Psalter, 1925; and The Oxford Song Book, 1929. He wrote chamber and organ music, anthems and hymn tunes. Death came at Hindhead in Surrey on October 3, 1947.",

    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "The authorship and date of this Latin hymn are unknown, but it was used widely in England and Ireland in the Middle Ages and it possibly as old as the fifth century. Sung at the Office of the Prime (early-morning service at 7:00 a.m., it has been translated a number of times, beginning variously with “Now the Daystar Glimmers Bright.” “Now With the Risen Star of Dawn,” and “Now the Daystar Glimmers Bright.” John M. Neale’s (1818-1866; see Biographies) translation is the most often used, but it has been altered, especially in the final stanza.\n\nNeale printed it in the Hymnal Noted, 1851, and in the English Hymns Ancient and Modern (1962  edition), the most successful hymnbook of all time, where it appeared as hymn No. 1.\n\nLAUREL, named after the composer’s niece, was first printed in Young Children Sing, 1967, with the text “Good Morning Sun!” In common with the canon of Thomas Tallis (SDAH 53), the tenor part is in canon with the soprano, beginning with the third beat and marked with an asterisk.\n\nDale Wood was born February 13, 1934, 18 years after his sister, while the family was living in Glendale, California. When only 13 years of age, he won first prize in a nationwide hymn-writing contest sponsored by the Luther League. The next year, while organist-choirmaster at Hope Lutheran Church in Hollywood, his first choral anthem was published–the forerunner of several hundred that have made him one of the best-known American church music composers. After study at Los Angeles Institute for the Arts, he served at Eden Lutheran Church, Riverside, California, and the Episcopal Church of St. Mary the Virgin in San Francisco. Here he was also the director for the San Francisco Cathedral School for Boys.\n\nArticles from his pen on liturgy, worship, and church music have been published in many journals, and he is much in demand as a conductor of choral festivals. In an article for  The Hymn (April 1972) titled “The Value of Hymns,” he wrote: “If we ever expect to witness a singing congregation which enjoys a wide exposure to good hymnody, it must start in the church school and choir rehearsal classrooms. None of our educational responsibilities could be more important than teaching hymns. The hymns we teach them [the children] will probably be their favorites in 10 to 50 years. Let us pack their minds with truly great hymns because they have a great message — not because we happened to learn them as children ourselves.”\n\nWood has served as editorial consultant for several hymnals, for the Inter-Lutheran Commission on Worship, and the international Choristers Guild. The American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) has honored Dale Wood annually since 1967 for his “very important contribution toward the creation and development of contemporary American music.” One critic called him “Mr. Joy,” a name that accurately describes his personality and has stuck with him ever since. At this writing, his creativity continues to flourish at his home in Sea Ranch, California, where he composes music and serves as editor for the Sacred Music Press, Dayton, Ohio.\n\nDale Wood also wrote EDEN CHURCH, SDAH 235, LAUREL is used again for the text “Every Flower that grows.” SDAH 550.",

    "historicalContext": "AGerman hymn dating from the early 1800s was printed in 1828 in the katholisches Gesangbuch (Catholic Hymnbook) in Wurzburg beginning with the words “Beim frühen Morgenlicht” (“In the early light of the morning”). Edward Caswall translated six stanzas in 1854, which appeared in Catholic Hymns, and then added another eight stanzas in 1958. The complete 14, or rather 28 stanzas of two lines each, followed by the refrain “May Jesus Christ be praised,” were printed in his Mosque of Mary, SDAH’s first two stanzas correspond to Caswall’s first four couplets, except for the slight change in the third couplet, which reads:\n\nThe sacred minster bell,\nIt peals o’er hill and dell;\nAll Scripture references are taken from the Psalms.\n\nThe tune LAUDES DOMINI (Praise the Lord) was composed especially for these words by Sir Joseph Barnby (1838-1896; see Biographies) and was first published in 1868, although he himself did not give names to any of the tunes he composed. The many phrased that have an upward progression are very appropriate for the joyous, exultant words.\n\nEdward Caswall was born on July 15, 1814, at his father’s vicarage at Yately in Hamshire, near Reading, Berkshire. He went to Marlborough School and in 1832 to Oxford, graduating with a B.A. in 1836 and an M.A. in 1838. Ordained deacon in the Church of England in 1838 and priest the nest year, he served brief curacies in Somerset, London, and Hertfordshire. In 1840 he was appointed curate at Stratford-sub-castle, near Salisbury, Wiltshire, where he remained until his resignation in 1846. He was interested in the Oxford movement and its Roman Catholic ritual, and was greatly influenced by John Henry Newman’s writings. He and his wife visited Rome in 1847, and on January 18 of that year he was received into the Roman Catholic Church, his wife following the next week. He had an independent income, and they moved to Torquay in Devonshire. His wife died in 1849, and Caswall went to the Oratory of St. Philip Neri in Edgbaston, Birmingham, where he worked with Newman, becoming deacon and then priest in his new communion. He spent the rest of his life there, caring for the sick, the poor, and little children. He is remembered for his almost 200 translations of Latin Hymns, which are very faithful to the original and pure in their rhythm, making them suitable for congregational singing. He died at Edgbaston on January 2, 1978, and was buried by his friend and mentor Cardinal Newman at Redwall, near Bromsgrove, Worcestershire.",

    "historicalContext": "Percy Dearmer (see SDAH 259), while editing the English hymnbook Songs of Praise (1931), wanted to use this lovely folk song melody, but found no text in this unusual meter, 5.5.5.4. (The SDAH has only this one.) Either he did not know that in the 1927 Revised Church Hymnary this tune was used with “Child in a Manger” or the committee rejected it. At any rate, he asked Eleanor Farjeon to write a poem to fit this melody that would help people to sing about their thankfulness for each new day as it comes.\n\nThe words remind us of Genesis 1:3-5: “And God said, let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.” And every morning, with “God’s re-creation of the new day,” it is our privilege to say, “It is of the Lord’s mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness” (Lam 3:22,23; see also SDAH 100).\n\nThe hymn was published in Songs of Praise, with the heading “Thanks for a Day,” and has since been used by many other hymnbook. In the 1960s it was appropriated and recorded by a well-known folk singer, which has helped to make it popular among young people.\n\nEleanor Farjeon was born February 13, 1881, at Westminster, London. Her father was a novelist, and she took quite naturally to a literary life, developing her talents by writing poems, stories, and music. She was prolific and successful, receiving the Carnegie Medal, the Hans Anderson International Medal, and the Regina Medal, mostly for the quality of her works for children. Among her more than 80 works are Nursery Rhymes of London Town, 1916; A Nursery in the Nineties, 1935; and Silversand and Snow, 1958. She died in London June 5,1965.\n\nBUNESSAN is a Gaelic folk melody first written down by Alexander Fraser after having heard it sung by a wandering Scottish Highlander. In 1888 Lachlan MacBean published it in Songs and Hymns of the Gael, with the text “Child in a Manger.” The name BUNESSAN is taken from a small township in Ross of Mull in the southeastern part of the Isle of Mull, birthplace of Mary MacDonald, who wrote the Gaelic original of this Christmas text.\n\nThe harmonically transparent arrangement by Melvin West is most appropriate for the folk song style of this music.",

    "translator": "Catherine Winkworth (1827-1878)",
    "yearWritten": 1863,
    "historicalContext": "The German original of this seven-stanza hymn was first published in 1732, in Benjamin Schmolck’s Kirchen Gefährte (Church Companion), and bore the title “Appearing Before God.” It was inspired by Psalm, 122:2: “Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.” Miss Winkworth’s (1827-1878; see Biographies) translation of five stanzas was included in her Chorale Book for England, 1863. It was also included in Horder’s Congregational Hymns, 1884, with very minor changes, one of them being “guiding star” for the original “polestar through my life” in the fourth stanza.\n\nSchmolck was born December 21, 1672, in Brauchitzchdorf, Silesia (between Czechoslovakia and Poland), the son of a Lutheran pastor. After several years of study at the Gymnasium at Luban, he came home and preached a sermon so good (for one so young) that one of the strong financial supporters of the church gave him a three-year scholarship to study theology at the University of Leipzig. Here he earned extra money composing special-occasion poems for wealthy people, and was crowned poet laureate in 1697. Returning home, he was ordained as his father’s assistant in 1701 and the next year was appointed to serve the Friedenskirke at Schweidnitz in Silesia.\n\nAbout this time a Counter-reformation movement resulted in the churched in this area being taken away from the Lutherans. For this whole district they were allowed only one church, and that outside the walls of town, made only of timber and clay and without a tower or bells. Schmolck and two other clergy had to minister to people scattered among 36 villages. Many restrictions hampered their work—in order to have prayer for a sick person, permission had to be obtained from the local Catholic priest. Here Schmolck ministered for 35 years, the final five of which he worked in spite of a stroke and near-blindness.\n\nHe was known as a hard worker lovingly tactful in dealing with people and their problems. He was the most popular hymn writer of his time, some 900 of his works being published and used all over Germany. He also wrote devotional books, cantatas, and occasional pieces for weddings and funerals. He died at Schweidnitz February 12, 1737, after a long illness. For another of his hymns in SDAH, see No. 389, “Light of Light, Enlighten Me.”\n\nThe tune UNSER HERRSCHER (Our Lord [Ruler]) was composed by Joachim Neander (1650-1680; see Biographies). It was first published in his Alpha und Omega, Galub- und Liebesübung (Alpha and Omega: The Practice of Faith and Love), in Bremen in 1680. The melody is most attractive, with the generally ascending tendency of the first two pairs of lines succeeded by the gradual descending repeated notes in the last two lines. The same tune, with somewhat different harmony, is used for SDAH 418, “Day of Judgement, Day of Wonders!”",

It is much loved and often sung in the meetings of this fellowship. The original was in 3/4 time, with quarter and eighth notes, which we have changed to 3/2 time, doubling the note values to encourage a slow, meditative tempo.\n\nNothing is known of the author. They hymn has appeared in American hymnals only four times, two of them Mormon hymnals and one a Primitive Baptist book. The earliest one was Gospel Melodies, 1884, a collection of sacred songs by William Harrison.\n\nBorn in Boston, Massachusetts, Harrison Millard (1830-1895) was an American composer and voice teacher. While very young he joined the Handel and Haydn Society. Later he studied music in Europe and returned to teach voice in New York City. In the Civil War he fought on the side of the Union and was wounded in the Battle of Chickamauga. His compositions include a grand Mass; a four-act opera, Deborah; and more than 300 songs.",

    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "It took the work of three authors to bring us this hymn in its present form. Reginald Heber wrote only the first stanza for and evening hymn and included it in his Hymns, 1827. In 1838 Richard Whately added stanza 3 of the SDAH version and printed it in Sacred Poetry Adapted to the Understanding of Children and Youth (Dublin). It is a free translation of the antiphon portion of the Latin “Nunc Dimittis” (see “Simeon’s Prayer,” SDAH 837; see also SDAH 67 and 682). William Mercer’s two stanzas were probably added in the 1850s.\n\nReginald Heber is best known for “Holy, Holy, Holy,” SDAH 73. He also wrote the Communion hymn “Bread of the World,” SDAH 398. In the early part of the nineteenth century most members of the Church of England despised the Methodist and independent churches and looked with disfavor on their practice of hymn singing, which had received tremendous impetus under Charles Wesley and Isaac Watts. However, Reginald Heber, a natural poet, noted the effect of hymn singing on the people and was determined to introduce the same enthusiasm into the Anglican Church, which at that time confined itself only to psalm singing or chanting. So in 1811 Heber began publishing his original hymns in the Christian Observer, and started a collection of hymns for each Sunday, based on the Gospel and the Epistles. He intended the particular hymn for the day to be sung between the sermon and the recital of the creed. The manuscript of his collection was submitted in 1820 to the archbishop of Canterbury but failed to receive his approval for use in the regular worship service. However, the collection was printed in 1826 in the third edition of Supplement to Psalms and Hymns for the Parish Church of Banbury. This hymn next appeared in his posthumous Hymns Written and Adapted to the Weekly Church Service of the Year, 1827. His window published the book and dedicated it to the archbishop of Canterbury, who had evidently changed his mind and given implicit approval to the publication.\n\nReginald Heber was born April 21, 1783, at Malpas, a small town near Chester in Cheshire, England. He attended the grammar school at Whitchurch and then later went to Brasenose College, Oxford, where he distinguished himself by winning the Newdigate Prize in 1803 for his long poem “Palestine.” After graduation he traveled in Europe, and then he was ordained in 1807 and appointed vicar of Hodnet in Shropshire, where his father had been rector and lord of the manor. A devoted parish priest, he wrote all of his hymns as well as other literary works at Hodnet. Always interested in India, he was offered the post of bishop of Calcutta three times. The third time he accepted, against his friends’ advice. When he arrived in India in 1823, he found that his See covered the whole of India and Ceylon, but he visited faithfully. Unfortunately, he contracted fever and died at Trichinopoly, south of Madras, on April 3, 1826.\n\nWilliam Mercer was born in 1811 at Barnard Castle, Durham, England, and studied at Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1840 he began 33 years of service as pastor in St. George’s Parish, Sheffield. He was successful in filling the Sunday school, and his preaching drew capacity crowds. With James Montgomery and John Goss, he edited The Church Psalter and Hymn Book,1854, which was for many years the most used hymnal in the Church of England. He died at Sheffield August 21, 1873.\n\nRichard Whately was born February 1, 1787, at Marylebone, London; he was educated at Oriel College, Oxford, and ordained a priest in 1814. His career included: Bampton lecturer; principal, St. Alban’s Hall, Oxford; the chair of political economy at Trinity College, Dublin; member of the Royal Irish Academy; and member of the House of Lords in Parliament. He was bishop of Dublin when he died October 8, 1863.\n\nAR HYD Y NOS, pronounced “Arr-heed-i-naws,” means “on length of night,” or “all through the night,” which is the English of the Welsh of a secular song set to this tune. It was first found in Edward Jones’s Musical Relicks of the Welsh Bards, 1784. It is said that Heber wrote this one stanza after hearing the tune played by a harper in a Welsh home. Lowell Mason (see Biographies) used it with the text “When the spark of life is waning,” and it has long been sung with the secular text “All through the night.”",

He practiced law for two years, but then studied for the ministry; in 1823 he was ordained a priest in the Protestant Episcopal Church. He was appointed professor of rhetoric and literature at Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut. It was here in 1824 that he published hi Songs by the Way, which contained this hymn poem headed “Evening” and with one other stanza:\n\nThou who, sinless, yet has known\nAll of man’s infirmity;\nThen, from Thine eternal throne,\nJesus, look with pitying eye.\n\nIn 1828 Doane was appointed rector of Trinity Church, Boston, and in 1832, bishop of New Jersey. He was the leader of the missionary movement in the Protestant Episcopal Church and founded St. Mary’s Hall, Burlington, New Jersey, in 1837 as a college for girls. The students there always sang this hymn for their Wednesday vesper service. He also founded Burlington College, an institution for men in 1846. He died April 27, 1859, at Burlington.\n\nThe tune SEYMOUR is an arrangement of the opening chorus of Oberon, written 1824 to 1826, the last opera of Carl Maria Friedrich Ernst von Weber (1786-1826). The arrangement was made by Henry William Greatorex (1813-1858; see SDAH 315) in 1851. Born in England, he came to the United States in 1839 and served as organist at the Center Church, Hartford, Connecticut.\n\nHe named the tune to commemorate a bass singer in the choir. Greatorex also contributed SDAH 315, MANOAH, and composed SDAH 660, GLORIA PATRI. In 1853 he moved to Charleston, South Carolina, where he died of yellow fever.",

    "historicalContext": "James Edmeston wrote this hymn in 1829 after reading Salte’s Travels in Abyssinia, in which he noted particularly the Ethiopian hymn sung at the end of the day. Over his two eight-line stanzas, now changed to four four-line ones, he wrote the quotation “At night their short evening hymn, “Jesus, forgive us,’ stole through the camp.” While some lines are almost direct quotations from Psalm 91, a summary of the hymn is expressed in Psalm 139:12: “Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee.” The last line has been changed from the original “May the morn in heaven awake us” in order to accord better with the doctrine of death’s being a sleep until the resurrection at the second advent of Christ.\n\nEdmeston was born in Wapping, east London, on September 10, 1791. He was trained to be an architect and surveyor, into which profession he entered in 1816 and remained all his life. A great lover of children, he visited often and supported the London Orphan Asylum. Although born into a family of Independent antecedents, he joined the Church of England. He used to write a hymn every Sunday to be read in the home for family worship. In all, he wrote about 2000 hymns, many of them for children, and they were assembled into about a dozen collections. Edmeston died at Homerton, east London, on January 7, 1867.\n\nThe tune EVENING PRAYER, or SUNSET, was composed in 1876 by George Coles Stebbins (1846-1945; see Biographies) as a response to be sung after prayer by his choir at the Boston Tremont Temple. The tune was used for Edmeston’s words in 1878. It is a tune suitable for trained singers, for each of the four parts carries a melody of its own.",

    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": 1847,
    "historicalContext": "This hymns by Henry Francis Lyte (1793-1847; see SDAH 4) has come into common use as an evening hymn; in reality it is an appropriate hymn for funerals as the eventide of life is meant, rather than the sunset of a normal day. It is based on the words of the two disciples as they reached their home in Emmaus on the day of the Resurrection and invited the Stranger to stay the night with them: “Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent” (Luke 24:29). But the words are used metaphorically. Witness, for example, the expression in stanza 2, “life’s little day,” and in stanza 4, “Where is death’s sting?” Early in his ministry Lyte visited a dying friend who constantly repeated the words “abide with me,” which may have had a lasting impression on Lyte’s mind. The hymn was written, however, in 1847 (otherwise it might have been included in his Poems of 1833), in his last curacy in Brixham, just before or after his last sermon before leaving for the Riviera to recuperate from asthma and tuberculosis. The hymn was printed in leaflet form in September 1847 and appears in Remains, 1859, by his daughter, and in his Miscellaneous Poems, 1868. There were eight stanzas.\n\nLyte also contributed hymns SDAH 4, “Praise, My Soul, the King of Heaven”; SDAH 25, “Praise the Lord, His Glories Show”; SDAH 325, “Jesus, I My Cross Have Taken”; and possibly SDAH 545, “Savior, Like A Shepherd.”\n\nLyte wrote his own tune for the words, but the hymn is now closely associated with EVENTIDE, composed in 1861 especially for these words and published in the 1861 edition of Hymns Ancient and Modern by its musical editor, William Henry Monk. After a committee meeting with his associate editor, Sir Henry Baker, at Monk’s home, both left, but the latter quickly recollected that they needed a tune for this hymn. He returned to the house, and in spite of a piano lesson being given in the next room, Monk dashed off the tune in 10 minutes. Later his widow said that at a time of great sorrow they were standing together watching the glories of the sunset, and under the inspiration of the moment Monk composed the tune in the gathering twilight.\n\nMonk was born March 16, 1823, in London and occupied his first position as a church organist when he was 18 years old. He served as organist in four London churches, successively, until 1849, when he was appointed to King’s College, where he also served as choir director. In 1874 he was appointed professor of vocal music at King’s. He is noted for his work as musical editor of the first and second editions of Hymns Ancient and Modern and for his anthems and choral works. He was honored in 1882 with the degree of D. Mus. By the University of Durham. Monk also composed SDAH 603, VIGILATE, and arranged SDAH 233, RATISBON. He placed a very high value on church music; the organ was, in his opinion, an instrument for reaching souls, not for showing skill. Monk died March 1, 1889, at Stoke Newington, London.",

    "historicalContext": "Bishop John H, Vincent was the founder, in 1874, of the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle, which gave 10-week summer lectures on Sunday school methods together with concerts and high-class entertainment. The group met at a former Methodist campground on the shore of Lake Chautauqua in the Finger Lakes district of New York State. He requested his assistant, Mary A. Lathbury to write a study hymn for the group, and the words of this hymn were the result, first sung on August 5, 1877, at the evening worship in the outdoors. The hymn was introduced to the congregation by the assistant director of music, George Coles Stebbins (1846-1945; see Biographies) who played the hymn as a cornet duet with his brother. The composer of the tune, William Fisk Sherwin, sang the hymn as a solo and then conducted the choir, all of whom were in boats a short distance from the shore. The refrain quotes Isaiah 6:3 “Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.” Lathbury wrote two additional stanzas a week after the first two, as she considered the hymn still unfinished. It is worthy of note that the vocative O in the refrain occurs on the single highest note of the melody.\n\nMary Artemisia Lathbury was born August 10, 1841, in Manchester, New York, and was very talented in drawing and writing. Her father was local preacher, and two of her brothers were Methodist ministers. She contributed articles and verse to religious periodicals and was a zealous worker for the Sunday school movement. She founded the Look Up Legion to recruit children; by 1885 where were 4000 children in Methodist Sunday schools. She was general director of the publications of the Methodist Sunday school Union and did much to help spread the Chautauqua movement throughout the United States. She also wrote SDAH 271, “Break Thou the Bread of Life,” in similar circumstances to the present hymn. Lathbury died at East Orange, New Jersey, on October 20, 1913.\n\nThe tune CHAUTAUQUA, also known as SENNENS and EVENING PRAISE, was composed by William Fisk Sherwin (1826-1888; see Biographies). The hymn appeared in the Calvary Selection of Sacred Songs, 1878.",

    "yearWritten": 1865,
    "historicalContext": "This hymn was written especially for the children of the parish of Horbury, near Wakefield in Yorkshire, England, by their young parish priest, Sabine Baring-Gould, in 1865. He lived in a tiny house with only one room and a little kitchen on the ground floor and another room above. It was before the days of universal education; Baring-Gould conducted in his house a night school for the children, some of whom worked all day in the wooled mills. The room downstairs was the “school” and upstairs was the “chapel.” In his book Reminiscences, he tells about it:\n\n“I began with night school every evening in the winter and with service every Sunday evening in the chapel. I had to stand on a stool before the chimney piece, on which was stood a cross and a pair of candlesticks. I wore no surplice, only a cassock. Very soon a congregation was formed, that grew till it not only filled the upper room but occupied the stairs as well, and the kitchen below. Hymns were performed somewhat laggingly, as the singing had to bump down the stairs, fill the kitchen, and one strain of the tune after another came up irregularly through the chinks in the floor to interfere with the smoothness and sequence of the melody as sung above. The notes from the stairs also jostled.”\n\nBaring-Gould was born on January 28, 1834, at Lew Trenchard, a large family estate on Dartmoor, 20 miles north of Plymouth in Devonshire. He spent much of his early years in France and Germany. He studied at Cambridge University, gaining hi B.A. in 1854 and M.A. two years later. He was appointed assistant master at a choir school in Pimlico, London, and the next year to a similar position at Hurstpierpoint College, north of Brighton in Sussex, where he remained until 1864. In that year he was ordained as an Anglican minister and appointed to the small town of Horbury. It was there that he saved a young mill girl from drowning, and sent her to a boarding school for further education. Then in 1868 he married her, for what was to be a long, happy, and fruitful union.\n\nIn 1866 he was appointed curate at Dalton, 20 miles northwest of York, and then in 1871 to east Mersea, eight miles south of Colchester in Essex. The next year his father died, and he returned to the family home on the edge of Datmoor, a huge property of 3000 acres. His uncle, who was the rector of the small community of about 200 persons at Lew Trenchard, died in 1881; as the Lord of the manor is was Baring-Gould’s privilege to appoints a successor, so he close himself, and remained there for the the rest of his life. His clerical duties were minimal, and he was able to accomplish an extraordinary output of writing, including fiction, religion, history, folklore, and travel, and he also collected folk songs, which he published. Possibly his best-known work was his Lives of the Saints, in 15 volumes. He also wrote SDAH 612, “Onward Christian Soldiers.” He died on January 2, 1924.\n\nBaring-Gould composed his own tune, EUDOXIA, for this poem, but in most American hymnals it has been displaced by MERRIAL, composed in 1868 by Joseph Barnby (1838-1896; see Biographies) and published with these words in Barnby’s Original Tunes to Popular Hymns, 1869. There it was unnamed, but Dr. Charles S. Robinson, an American, in his collection Spiritual Songs for Social Worship, 1878, named it EMMELAR to commemorate his daughter Mary by her initials M.L.R., which easily slurs into EMMELAR. However, Robinson later changed the name to its present one, using the same device for Mary L., which becomes MERRIAL.\n\nThe tune is noteworthy for the fact that of the 23 notes in the melody, more than half are the note E, a series of six in succession beginning the tune and a succession of seven ending it. Far from being monotonous, though, the tune is accompanied by harmony that varied considerably in both tenor and bass parts. Unusual also is the small range of four notes in the soprano and alto parts.",

    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": 1674,
    "historicalContext": "In 1674 Thomas Ken, then prebendary of Winchester Cathedral, published A Manual of Prayers for the Use of the Scholars of Winchester College, in which he advised the scholars to “be sure to sing the morning and evening hymn in your chamber devoutly, remembering that the psalmist, upon happy experience, assures you that it is a good thing to tell of the loving-kindness of the Lord early in the morning and of His truth in the night season.” The hymns had been printed unauthorized in 1692 and in 1693, so Ken published his “three hymns for morning, evening, and midnight” in 1694 and added them to his 1695 edition of A Manual of Prayers. They were somewhat revised for the 1709 edition, from which the SDAH hymn is taken. Out of an original 12 stanzas, SDAH utilizes numbers 1, 2, 4, and 12.\n\nThomas Ken was born at Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, in 1637. When he was 9 years old, he was orphaned and went to live with his brother-in-law Izaak Walton. In 1651 he was a scholar at Winchester school, from which he went up to Oxford, gaining his B.A. in 1661. He was ordained in 1662 and in 1663 was appointed rector of Little Easton, a village in Essex, less that four miles east of the future site of London’s Stansted Airport. In 1667 he was appointed rector of Brightstone in the Isle of Wight, and two years later prebendary of Winchester Cathedral. In 1679 he was appointed chaplain to Princess Mary, then living at The Hague, but was dismissed after a year for speaking out against immorality in the courts of Holland and England and against King Charles II. In 1685 he was appointed by Charles II as bishop of Bath and Wells. Uncompromising in principle, in 1688 he refused to read the Declaration of Indulgence and was imprisoned by James II. He was deprived of his bishopric, and when invited to accept it after the death of his successor, he refused. He was noted as being bold yet gentle, pious, and kind. Ken died at a friend’s estate at Longleat, Wiltshire, on March 19, 1711. SDAH 694 and 695 are also by Thomas Ken and actually are the last stanza of this present hymn.\n\nThe tune TALLIS’ CANON was chosen by Ken for each of his three hymns and appears in a psalter issued between 1561 and 1567 by Matthew Parker, archbishop of Canterbury. It was composed by Thomas Tallis (c. 1505-1585), who was born, it is thought, in Leicestershire. By 1532 Tallis is mentioned as being an organist at Dover Priory and then in 1537, at Waltham Abbey in Essex. He was a chorister at Canterbury Cathedral and later became a gentleman of the Chapel Royal, then situated at Greenwich. He was able to serve royalty of both the Protestant and Catholic persuasions and was successively royal organist to Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary, and Elizabeth of the house of Tudor. Tallis was given a monopoly on printing music and music paper by Queen Elizabeth. Known as the father of English cathedral music, he composed choral music, masses, motets, anthems, and hymn tunes. He died at Greenwich in Ken on November 23, 1585.\n\nA canon is a piece of music which after a few beats one part repeats a preceding part exactly. In this particular tune the tenor part copies the soprano part exactly, except it is four beats behind. In other words, if the tenor part is played separately, it will appear to sound unfinished to one who knows the tune, or soprano part, but if the first four notes are added, it will be recognized as the complete tune. Alto and bass parts are added later to complete the harmony.",

    "historicalContext": "Here we have one of the oldest surviving Christian hymns, dating from before the third century. About the year 379 Saints Basil quoted it as ancient and of unknown authorship and date. It comes from the service book of the Greek Orthodox Church and is sung at the lighting of the lamps for the vesper service. Hence it is known as the “Candlelight Hymn.” There are more than two dozen English translations of this hymn, including one by John Keble (see SDAH 502)) and the one by Longfellow in his Golden Legend, 1851. The translation by Robert Bridges (1844-1930; see SDAH 5), which the SDAH uses, was published in Hymns in Four Parts With English Words for Singing in Churches, Part IV, 1899, then in the Yattendon Hymnal that same year. It became widely known and used after inclusion in the English Hymnal, 1906.\n\nThese words are given by the composer of the tune PHOS HILARON to help us “sing with understanding”: “As one of the oldest and more beautiful of evening hymns, the committee felt that a new tune needed to be created for it. Its unusual meter meant that the only other tune available, and the one most often used, was NUNC DIMITTIS, from the Genevan Psalter of 1549. A more contemporary sound was desired. I decided to used the pentatonic scale [a five-note melody that can be played on the black notes of the piano] to accentuate its Eastern origin. The hymn is still used for the lighting of the candles at evensong in the Anglican, Roman Catholic, and Greek Orthodox churches. It is a unison hymns, harmonized sparingly. It must not be hurried, but sung reflectively — almost mystically. The name PHOS HILARON [Glad Light — these are the first two words of the Greek hymn] is the Greek name for the hymn and is known as such by the churches that use it liturgically.”\n\nJame Thomas Bingham was born July 27, 1945, in Geelong, Victoria, Australia, a second-generation Australian of English background. At an early age he began the study of violin and piano, becoming assistant organist in his home church in his early teens. Singing in church and evangelistic choirs through his high school years helped to develop a keen interest in the renowned Avondale Symphonic Choi, which toured Australia in concert under the direction of Alan Thrift. Graduating from the Seventh-day Adventist Avondale College in 1967, he taught music one year in two high schools in his hometown, Geelong, before going to Andrews University, Berrien Springs, Michigan, for graduate work. Here he studied musical composition and theory with Blythe Owen (see SDAH 277) and Charles Hall, and in 1970 he earned the M.A. degree.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1980 he taught music at Kingsway College, Oshawa, Ontario, Canada, becoming chairman of the Music Department in 1973. The Kingsway Symphonic Choir he established became well known in Canada and the United States for its pursuit of excellence in sacred choral repertoire. At the 1980 Seventh-day Adventist General Conference session, held in Dallas, Texas, he was the assistant director of the massed choir. During this period he continued to study with Lloyd Bradshaw, Toronto University; Patricia Holt, Toronto Royal Conservatory of Music; and David Willcocks, Loma Linda University. From 1980 to 1984, his study at Andrews University, at Westminster Choir College of Princeton, New Jersey, and with hymnologists Erik Routley and James Litton led to graduation with a Ph.D. in religious education. After a time as minister of music at the First Congregational church of Benton Harbor, Michigan, he accepted a call to be chairman of the mUsic Department at Atlantic Union College, South Lancaster, Massachusetts.\n\nBingham served as a member of the SDAH Committee and worked on the tunes subcommittee as wee as the committee for the Index of Hymns Suitable for Young Worshipers (see SDAH, p. 809) Bingham also composed tunes for SDAH 81, JANELLE; SDAH 102, YOU YANGS; and SDAH 148, INFINITE LOVE.",

    "historicalContext": "Mary Lundie was born on April 26, 1814, at Kelso, in Roxburgh, Scotland. Her father was the minister of the church there, and in 1836 she married another minister, William Wallace Duncan, taking up married life at Cleish, in Kinross. In the latter half of 1839 Duncan wrote 23 hymns, mostly for her children, Mary and Harry, this little hymn being one of them. In December 1839 she caught a chill, which turned to a fever, and she died on January 5, 1840, at Cleish. Her mother published her memoirs in 1841, which included the hymn. Her younger sister, Catherine, married Horatius Bonar (see SDAH 79).\n\nThe tune SHIPSTON is named after the town of Shipston-on-Stour in Warwickshire, 10 miles south of Stratford-on-Avon. It was at the nearby village of Holford that Lucy Broadwood (?-1929) collected a folk song called “Bedlam City,” a ballad telling of the lament of a maiden for her lover Billy, who had been killed in the war. The song appears in English County Songs, 1893, edited by Broadwood and J.A. Fuller-Maitland. The first half of this tune has been harmonized by Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872-1958; see Biographies) for the English Hymnal, 1906. SHIPSTON is also used for SDAH 544, “Jesus, Son of Blessed Mary’; there it is transported down a half step.",

    "historicalContext": "John Ellerton wrote the hymn entitled “Evening” in 1870 for “A Liturgy for Missionary Meetings” borrowing the first line from an anonymous hymn in Church Poetry, 1855. Originally there were five stanzas, the omitted one being:\n\nThe sun that binds us rest is walking\nOur brethren ‘neath the western sky,\nAnd hour by hour fresh lips are making\nThy wondrous doings heard on high.\n\nEllerton was born in Clerkenwell, London, on December 16, 1826, and gained a B.A. from Cambridge University in 1849. He was ordained to the Anglican ministry in 1850 and appointed as curate in the village of Easebourne in Sussex. In 1852, he was moved to Brighton; he was awarded his M.A. in 1854, and in 1860 was appointed vicar of Crewe Green and chaplain to Lord Crewe. In 1872 he moved to Shropshire; in 1876 he was appointed to Barnes in Surrey. He ministered there until 1884 when his health broke down. After two years during which he visited the Continent, he accepted the appointment of rector at White Roding in Essex. In 1892 he was called to be canon of St. Albans Cathedral, but before he was officially installed he died at Torquay on June 15, 1893, on a visit there. He wrote, about 80 hymns, including SDAH 161, “Throned Upon the Awful Tree,” and had a part in several hymnals (e.g., Church Hymnals, of 1871); he also translated several hymns from the Latin. Ellerton refused any copyright fees for his own hymns, grateful for the fact that they could be used in praise of God.\n\nThe tune ST. CLEMENT was composed especially for these words by Clement Cotterill Scholefield, a self taught musician with no prior systematic training in music. He was born in Edgbaston, Birmingham, on June 22, 1839, he gained a B.A. from Cambridge University in 1863 and a M.A. in 1867. He was ordained that same year and served as a curate in Brighton from 1867 to 1869, then in London at Kensington until 1879, and at Chelsea from 1879 to 1880. For the next 10 years he was chaplain at Eton College, and from 1890 to 1895 back in London as a vicar in Knightsbridge. He retired to Godalming in Surrey, where he died on September 10, 1904. He wrote several songs and hymn tunes, this one in 1874 when he was curate of St. Paul’s, south Kensington. At the same time, Arthur Seymour Sullivan (1842-1900; see SDAH 169) was the organist at this church and was preparing the music for Church Hymns and Tunes, 1874. Sullivan was the musical editor and included Scholefield’s tune, which had not been named. He “canonized” his friend by calling the tune ST. CLEMENT!",

    "historicalContext": "Here are stanzas 1, 8, and 9 of the nine stanzas written by Paul Gerhardt (1607-1676; see Biographies) and first published in the 1648 edition of Johann Crüger’s Praxis Melica. It is considered one of the finest of Gerhardt’s hymns and was a favorite of the German poet Johann Schiller. John Julian record the words of Baron Bunsen in Evangelische Kirkenzeitung, 1830: “Ever since its publication this hymn has been one of the most loved and best-known hymns of devout meditation over the whole of Germany. Experienced and conceived in a truly childlike popular spirit, it unites with a rare, naive simplicity of expression, a loftiness of thought, a depth of Christian experience, a grace of poetry, so that for this union of qualities it must rank as an enduring masterpiece among hymns.” It was often sung by children as their prayer before going to bed. The Yattendon Hymnal, 1899, included English poet Robert Bridges’ paraphrase “The Duteous Day Now Closeth.” The SDAH translation by Catherine Winkworth (1827-1878; see Biographies) was printed in her Lyra Germanica, second edition, 1856.\n\nPaul Gerhardt wrote more than 120 hymns, most of which immediately became popular; a quarter of them are still favorites in Germany today. Born March 12, 1607, near Wittenberg, he was orphaned in early childhood. He attended the University of Wittenberg, planning to become a Lutheran minister, In 1642 he went to Berlin and was the tutor for the daughter of an advocate. After ordination as a Lutheran pastor in 1651, he married his former pupil and moved to Lubben, south Berlin.\n\nHis life was a sad one, even apart from the fact that he lived during the Thirty Years’ War (1618-1648), for four of his five children died in infancy and his wife died following a long illness after only 13 years of marriage. He had been deposed from his position because of a conflict between the elector of the Reformed Church and the Lutheran clergy in 1666, but after two years without employment he was appointed archdeacon at Lubben, holding this position until his death May 27, 1676.\n\nIn spite of his bereavements, disappointments, and sorrow, his faith and trust in God remained unshaken, and his hymns reveal a remarkable confidence in his heavenly Father. They are mostly introspective and echo the feelings of many Christians, which accounts for their great popularity then and now. Gerhardt also translated from the Latin SDAH 156, “O Sacred Head Now Wounded,” and wrote SDAH 519, “Give to the Winds Your Fear.”\n\nINNSBRUCK means “bridge over the Inn River.” The name comes from a fifteenth-century German folk song, “Innsbruck, I Must Leave Thee.” Isaak’s arrangement was printed in George Foster’s Ein Auszug guter alter und neuer Teutschen Liedlein, 1539 (A Selection of Good Old and New Songs), where the melody had a little different form. O WELT ICH MUSS DICH LASSEN (O World, I Must Leave Thee) is another name for this tune, taken from the first line of a hymn by Johann Hess, often used with this music.\n\nHeinrich Isaak, born about 1450 in the Netherlands of Germany, was an international composer and music personality whose work was admired by Martin Luther. From 1477 to 1493 he served as organist at the Medici Chapel, Florence, Italy, and was a tutor for the children of Lorenzo the Magnificent, one of whom later became Pope Leo X. Then for 18 years he was chapel master to Emperor Maxmillian I at Innsbruck. His compositions include Choralis Constantinus (musical settings of the service for the entire church year), which Albert Einstein called “one of the greatest documents not only in the history of music but also in the history of art.”\n\nHe also wrote masses, motets, sacred and secular songs, and instrumental music. He was prolific and wrote in all the musical styles prevalent in his day. In Italy he was known as “Henry the German.” The place and date of his death are uncertain; some say Rome in 1527, others Florence in 1517.\n\nJ.S. Bach (1685-1750; see Biographies) liked this tune well enough to use it in both the St. Matthew Passion and the St. John Passion and in cantatas 13, 44, and 97. SDAH uses his harmonization from the first version in the St. Matthew Passion, only a half step lower. There are 12 different versions of this fine choral in Charles Sanford Terry’s Four-Part Chorals of Johann S. Bach. Johannes Brahms employed it in his Chorale Preludes, Opus 122, Nos. 3 and 11; the latter in thought to be his final composition.",

    "historicalContext": "These words first appeared as a glee for four voices in A Selection of Popular National Airs, With Symphonies and Accompaniments by Sit John Stevenson, Mus. Doc. The Words by Thomas Moore, Esq. (London, 1818). Here it was called RUSSIAN AIR and in many collections is attributed to Dimitri Bortniansky. However, noted hymnologist Leonard Ellinwood says that a search through Bortniansky’s works turned up nothing remotely resembling this tune. Stevenson added a third line to the music to make it a conventional hymn tune, as found in the Episcopal Hymnal, 1940, where it is named VESPER HYMN, as in several other hymnals. Max Exner, about whom nothing is known, evidently adapted the three lines to make it into a canon.\n\nThe tune came to America and was included in Joshua Leavitt’s Christian Lyre, 1830. It had previously been in a German collection, Die Neue Harmonie (The New Harmony) and a Collection of Church Music, 1827, by Michael Bentz, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Between this date and 1957 it was used by 35 American hymnals.\n\nThomas Moore wrote many songs to airs already popular, for example, “The Last Rose of Summer” and “Believe Me if All Those Endearing Young Charms.” Also, see SDAH 477, “Come, Ye Disconsolate,” which he wrote.\n\nThe Latin word jubilate (“be joyful”) recalls Psalm 149:5: “Let the saints be joyful in glory.”\n\nMoore was born May 28, 1779, in Dublin, Ireland (his birth and death dates were given incorrectly in the first four printings of SDAH) and was educated at Trinity College, Dublin. Then he went to London in 1799 to study for the bar; on completion he was appointed in 1803 as registrar of the Admiralty Court on the island of Bermuda. He returned to England in 1804 and made a name for himself as an Irish poet, writing odes, poems, and a biography of Byron, and collecting melodies. His hymns appear in his Sacred Songs, 1816, which contains 32 of his compositions, and in his collected works of 1866. He died at the small village of Chittoe, just east of Bath, England, on February 25, 1852.\n\nJohn Andrew Stevenson (1761-1833) was born in Dublin, and admitted as a chorister of Christ Church Cathedral there at age 10. After five years in the choir of St. Patrick’s Cathedral, he became a vicar-choral there in 1783 and went back to Christ Church in 1800. In 1791 Dublin University gave him honorary D.Mus. degree, and he was knighted in 1803. His final post was as organist and music director of the Castle Chapel. He wrote works for the stage; oratorio, Thanksgiving; and a number of songs, but his main claim to fame is his collection Irish Melodies,1807, set to words of Thomas Moore. In St. Patrick’s Cathedral, Dublin, a monument has been erected to his memory.\n\nMelvin West (1930- ) wrote the accompaniment, either half of which can be played for the duration of the canon.",

    "historicalContext": "In Germany in the seventeenth century it was customary for the congregation to sing “sermon hymn,” part immediately before the sermon and part just after the sermon had ended. Tobias Clausnitzer published such a hymn, “Liebster Jesu wir Sind hier, Dich und Dein Wort anzuhören” (Dearest Jesus, WE Are Here to Listen to Thee and Thy Word), to be sung before the sermon. The direct statements in the first two lines and throughout the hymn express the desire of the congregation to hear God’s Word, thus preparing their minds to receive the message of the sermon immediately to follow. The translation into English was made by Catherine Winkworth (1827-1878; see Biographies), keeping, as was her custom, to the original meter of the chorale.\n\nClausnitzer was born February 5, 1619, at Thum, near what is now, Karl-Marx-Stadt. During the last four years of the Thirty Years’ War he was chaplain to a Swedish regiment, leaving in 1649 after the peace of Westphalia. He became a Lutheran pastor at Weiden, a town in what is now East Germany, ministering there until his death on May 7, 1684. Winkworth’s title was “Before Public Worship,” and she adds the author’s name with the date 1671. Her translation appears in her Lyra Germanica, Second Series, 1858.\n\nLIEBSTER JESU was published in 1664 by Johann Rudolph Ahle (1625-1673), of Mühlhausen in the Thuringian forest of East Germany, but for the words of another hymn in the same meter. Ahle was an accomplished organist and composer who copied the Italian school of rhythm and ornate melody in an attempt to break away from the dull and stodgy German church music of the time. His so-called sacred arias, however, were subjected to much criticism and were considered as introducing too lively a secular influencer into sacred singing. He served as organist at Erfurt and at St. Blasius Church in Mühlhausen.",

    "yearWritten": 1937,
    "historicalContext": "As with many of the hymns by Pratt Green (1903- ), this one was written to fill a special need. Rusell Schulz-Widmar (see SDADH 13), codirector of music at University United Methodist Church, Austin, Texas, wrote: “We are in need of a hymn. It would be sung for the first time at the closing service of an eight-month-long festival centering round the themes of worship, music, and the arts… The closing service of this festival will center around the dedication of new reading desks, Communion table, and font, and finally, the rededication of the people to the life commanded of us and given through Jesus Christ… We would prefer a meter of 8.7.8.7.D since we could then use your text to introduce the tune ABBOT’S LEIGH to our congregation.”\n\nIn stanza 2, the original line “Here the cross has central place” has been changed to “Here the Word has central place” to reflect the feeling of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in this regard.\n\nThe tune ABBOT’S LEIGH was written by Cyril Vincent Taylor in 1941 when he was on the staff of the British Broadcasting Company for the planning of religious services on the air, Because of the bombing of London (World War II), the staff had been evacuated to Bristol. Then when Bristol was under air attack, he moved out to the village of Abbot’s Leigh, where he stayed with a friend for four or five months. He tells about writing his first hymns tune: “On that Sunday morning I sat down at the piano in their dining room. No one else was there. I had to spent most of my Sundays at home listening to the broadcasts. I wrote the outline of the tune that morning, intending it to be sung to ‘Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken.’ Some have speculated that I wrote it as an alternative to ‘Deutschland über alles!’ I don’t remember that that was so. Of course, there were many critics who wrote the BBC asking, ‘Why do you sing a German tune?” But at least consciously it was not for that reason. And then like most tunes it had to be touched up in various ways. The Oxford Press asked me to write a different ending. Being young and having no professional skill in those matters, I altered it. Well, I can see now that I was obviously wrong [in changing it], of they were. They printed it like that, but they eventually discarded the leaflet, I’m glad to say. Later it was put in Hymns Ancient and Modern 1950, and the BBC Hymnbook… Just before being put in the hymnbook, one of my colleagues, Dr. George Thalben Ball, the great organist, seized it, saying we must broadcast it in a little program we had each morning called Lift Up Your Hearts. Hymns were played before and after to provide a kind of buffer; and this is how the tune first became known—it was recorded by the BBC orchestra for use before and after the program. All the same, it has taken many years to reach the peak of familiarity which it now knows” (The Hymn, January 1984).\n\nHe continues by telling how some have had difficulty with the big downward leap in the melody in the final phrase, and how he solved it. “When I was in a village in the country of Dorset and had to train our little choir, the only way I could get them to go right down was physically to disappear beneath the choir stalls. When they saw me go down, they went down with me!” In spite of this small difficulty, it has become one of the most successful of the modern hymn tunes.\n\nBorn December 11, 1907, in the coal mining town of Wigan, Lancashire, England, Taylor sang in the choir of Magdalen College, Oxford, until age 16. Then he went to Christ Church, Oxford, where he earned a B.A. degree. After graduate study at Cambridge, he became a priest in the Church of England and served in a number of posts before spending 14 years as assistant to the head religious broadcasting at the BBC. As a theologian and musician, he was one of the editors of the BBC Hymnbook, which included some 20 of his hymn tunes. In 1953 he was appointed warden and chaplain of the Royal School of Church Music; in 1958, perpetual vicar of Cerne Abbas, Dorset, with responsibility for village parishes nearby; and in 1969, precentor and residenciary canon at Salisbury Cathedral. Associated with Hymns Ancient and Modern for more than 20 years, he helped compile two supplements, 100 Hymns for Today, and More Hymns for Today, which were merged with the best of Hymns Ancient and Modern to become New Standard Hymns Ancient and Modern. An anthem setting of “God is here,” arranged for choir and brass by Austin Lovelace, has been published by Oxford University Press.\n\nSee SDAH 583, “You That Know the Lord,” for the same tune in a lower key.",

    "historicalContext": "After the Reformation in Scotland, the people turned away from the Latin service in the Roman Church and began holding services in their own language. Metrical psalmody (singing metrical versions of the psalms) was the only part of worship in which the congregations of the Scottish churches joined until about 1749. In the three principal sections on the Presbyterian Church (which was born in Scotland), the singing of hymns did not become at all general till after 1852, in the United Presbyterian Church, after 1870 in the Established Church, and after 1873 in the Free Church. So it is easy to see how the use of the psalms in worship, beginning as early as 1533 when Clement Marot began his versions, could have established such a powerful influence on the Scottish mind and heart.\n\nIn an attempt to have uniformity of worship in England and Scotland, the House of Commons authorized the Psalms of David in English Meeter, 1646. But the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland was not happy with this revision and appointed a committee of four men to make their own version. It was printed in 1650 as The Psalms of David in Meeter. Newly translated and diligently compared with the Original Text and former Translations; More plain, smooth, and agreeable to the Text than any heretofore. Allowed by the Authority of the General Assembly of the Kirk of Scotland, and appointed to be sung in Congregations and Families. Edinburgh. Hymnologist John Julian says that this psalter has “survived all proposals to modernize it,… and remains to this day [1907] the only version of the Psalms used y Presbyterian Scotland… and its faithfulness, vigor, and terseness cannot be denied.”\n\nMCKEE is named after Elmer M. Mckee, pastor of St. George’s Episcopal Church, New York City, where Harry T. Burleigh was the baritone soloist from 1894 to1946. Burleigh won this job over 59 White applicants for the post, even though there was much opposition to having a Black in such a position. His first solo was “The Palms,” by Fauré, and he sang it for 52 consecutive Palm Sundays in that church!\n\nHe adapted the Negro spiritual “I Know the Angel’s Done Changed My Name,” sung by the Fisk Jubilee Singers and included in their book Jubilee Songs, edited in 1884 by Theodore Seward and George White, Burleigh sand it in his church for many years. Hymnal 1940 included MCKEE for the first time in a major hymnal with “In Christ There Is No East nor West” (see SDAH 587).\n\nHarry Thacker Burleigh was born December 2, 1866, in Erie, Pennsylvania, and there did the usual odd jobs—selling papers, running errands, and lighting street lamps. After singing in the boy’s choir of St. Paul’s Cathedral, Erie, he won a scholarship to the National Conservatory of Music, where he met Anton Dvorak, composer of New World Symphony. Concurrently with the 25-years, from 1900 to 1925. On two different occasions he sang for King Edward VII of England.\n\nHe was a charter member of the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP), and did editorial work for G. Rocordi Music Publishers, New York. Atlanta University awarded him an honorary master’s degree, and Howard University honored him with the D.Mus. degree, His works include 90 songs, 50 choral works, and 49 arrangements of spirituals for solo voice with independent piano accompaniment. His work in this field marked the beginning of the use of spirituals as concert music by most of the well-known artists. The great tenor John MacCormack made famous his “Little Mother of Mine.” Burleigh is recognized as the first Black to achieved success in the serious music world. He died at Stamford, Cennecticut, September 11, 1949.",

Powell’s Collection of Hymns and Sacred Poems, Dublin, 1749, the tune IRISH was published with some other tunes at the end of the book and was unnamed. Caleb Ashworth named it IRISH TUNE in his Collection of Hymns and Sacred Poems, c. 1760.Curiously, in the book Jacobite Relics of Scotland, 1819, it is given as the melody for a little political song, “The Cameronian Cat.” It was not used as a hymn until it surfaced in a Scottish hymnbook in 1793. It was not clear whether IRISH began its life as a folk song or a hymn tune. In Ireland it has long been used with Watts’s “O God, Our Help in Ages Past.”",

    "yearWritten": 1773,
    "historicalContext": "This hymn first appeared in A Supplement to the Shawbury Hymn Book, 1773, but without signature or credit given to the author, which was not uncommon at that time. The first indication as to the author comes in a Nonconformist collection entitled Selection of Psalms for Social Worship, 1786, where it is signed “F”, which in the authors’ list represents J. Fawcett. The editor does admit that the accuracy of this list is only as good as his memory. However, in 1791, in the seventh edition of A Collection of Psalms and Hymns, compiled by J. Harris, a Nonconformist minister from Hull, the full name of Fawcett is given. Seeing that John Fawcett himself was a Baptist minister, it is likely that the identification is correct.\n\nThe hymn recalls the Aaronic blessing “The LORD bless thee, and keep thee… and be gracious unto thee… and give thee peace” (Num 6:24, 25). This is all the more apt, as the last line of the first stanza has been changed to “Wilderness” from the original “in this dry and barren place.” Fawcett also wrote SDAH 350, “Blest Be the Tie That Binds.”\n\nJohn Fawcett was born on January 6, 1740, near Bradford, Yorkshire. At the age of 16 he was converted by the evangelist George Whitefield. In 1765 he was ordained as a Baptist minister, serving at Wainsgate (see SDAH 350). In 1782 he published a collection of 166 of his own hymns, Hymns Adapted to the Circumstances of Public Worship and Private Devotion, although this hymn and other that he wrote are not included. In his preface to this book, he wrote: “When I have digested my thought on some portion of God’s Word, I have frequently attempted to sum up the leading ideas, in a few plain verses, to be sung after the sermon; that so they might be more impressed on my own heart and on the heart of my hearers.” In 1811 Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, granted him an honorary D.D. degree. He died at Hebden Bridge, Halifax, Yorkshire, July 25, 1817.\n\nSICILIAN MARINERS was included in The European Magazine and London Review of November 1792, where it is set to  “The Sicilian Mariner’s Hymn to the Virgin.” It appeared later in other collections, taking with it the tune name SICILIAN MARINERS. Today in Sicily the tune is unknown, but it does resemble some folk tunes of southern France. The European Magazine says that Sicilian sailors sing the hymn when the sun sets, and an 1866 source says that the Venetian gondoliers sang it, especially on St. Mary’s Day.",

    "historicalContext": "Jeremiah Eames Rankin was born January 2, 1828, in Thornton, New Hampshire; he received his early musical training in singing schools and in the village choir. He began teaching when he was 17 years old and later went to the Andover Theological Seminary to train for the ministry. Ordained as a minister of the Congregational church in 1855, he ministered in New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, the District of Columbia, and New Jersey. He died November 28, 1904, in Cleveland, Ohio. During the Civil War he was on the staff of General Howard and was later a government employee in Washington, D.C. While he was pastor of the First Congregational church at Tenth and G streets in Washington, D.C., he had several government officials in his congregation. Such officials were frequently moved, and as a consequence, many goodbyes had to be said. In 1880 Rankin wrote the first stanza of this hymn as an etymological composition of the word goodbye, which is simply an abbreviation of the blessing “God be with you.” The apostle Paul closes many of his Epistle with a similar greeting: “The God of love and peace shall be with you” (2nd Cor. 13:11), although on most occasions he mentions the Lord Jesus Christ rather than God. Rankin was appointed president of Howard University in 1889.\n\nIn order to obtain a suitable tune for this poem, he sent it to two friends. One was a well-known composer; the other, a schoolmaster and amateur musician, William Gould Tomer, who was born October 5, 1833, in New Jersey and died September 26, 1896, in the same state. Tomer had served in the infantry in the Civil War and 20 years in government employ. At the time he wrote this tune he was director of music at the Grace Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C. His tune was preferred, which stimulated Rankin to write three more stanzas. The tune was later revised by the organist of Rankin’s church, John W. Bischoff (1849-1909). It is somewhat in the form of a chant, as the same chord is used for several successive syllables. Bischoff, who was blind, was choir director of the church for 35 years; he also composed the unnamed tune for SDAH 515, “The Lord Is My Light.”",

In many hymnbooks this has taken the place of Willian Tomer’s tune in the gospel song idiom, but the SDAH Committee felt that both tunes deserved a place in the hymnal.\n\nFor comments on the text and Jeremiah Rankin (1828-1904), see SDAH 65.",

    "historicalContext": "In 1924 Ernest Edwin Ryden (1886-1981; see SDAH 37) wrote this hymn, based on Simeon’s prayer in Luke 2:29-32: “Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word; for mine eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast prepared before the face of all people; a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.” No. 837 in the Scripture Readings section of SDAH is the Jerusalem Bible version of this prayer, commonly known throughout Christendom by its first two Latin words, “Nunc Dimittis.”\n\nRyden’s hymn was first published in The Hymnal, 1925, by the Lutheran Church, Augustana Synod. Alterations have been made to change “thee” and “thou” to “you” and “your.”\n\nThe Finnish tune NYLAND appeared in the 1909 edition of Finland’s Evangelical Lutheran Church Chorale Book. A recent version of that book states that NYLAND is a folk tune first sung near Kuortane, a small village in south Ostrobothnia, Finland. (The tune is sometimes called KUORTANE.) The harmonization SDAH uses was made by David Evans (1874-1948; see Biographies), musical editor of Revised Church Hymnary, 1927. He used the tune in that book, introducing it for the first time to English congregations. The name Nyland (a province in Finland) was given it by Millar Patrick, a coeditor of Revised Church Hymnary, 1927.",

    "historicalContext": "According to Mark Miles Fisher in his book Negro Slave Song in the United States, “the Quakers of North Carolina bought numerous slaves and, through their Manumission Society that was established July 19, 1816, sent them to other countries. Africa was one of the places American Negros desired to go. In a song called ‘Deep River’ that originated in Guilford Country, North Carolina (where it was the name both of a body of water and the meetinghouse of the Quakers), a conservative slave told his Quaker benefactor that he wanted to ‘cross over’ to Africa, the home pf camp meetings.”\n\nSo it appears that what has universally been considered a double meaning in the song, ‘Deep river, I want to cross over into campground,” is actually a longing to be free and go back to Africa. When framed in these particular words, it can also be taken to mean, “I want death to come so that the next time I awaken it will be in the heavenly campground.”\n\nFisher continues, “By late 1824 the interest of Negroes was waning in African colonization. A transport ship had sailed for Africa in January 1824; the next one did not arrived there until almost 12 months later. Some slaves imagined that they somehow were to blame for not being transported home. They used their hymns for farewell songs at religious gatherings. One of the Negroes of Charleston, South Caroline, asked the Lord, meaning, perhaps, both God and his earthly master, to make him willing to wait like ‘poor Daniel’ [in another spiritual] for another opportunity to go home to Africa.”\n\nLord, make me more patient [or able to wait]\nLord, make me more patient,\nLord, make me more patient,\nUntil we meet again.\nPatient, patient, patient,\nUntil we meet again.\n\nAnd so it originally appeared. Other stanzas included “holy,” “loving,” or “peaceful,” as the slaves waited.\n\nThis tune is found in a slightly different form (see example below) in the southern United States tunebook Wesleyan Psalmist, compiled by M.L. Scudder in 1842. Joseph Hillman also included it with the text “O brother, be faithful until we meet again” in his shaped-note tune book Revivalist, published in 1868 in Troy, New York. Other stanzas used were “O Sister, be faithful,” “There we shall see Jesus,” “There’ll be no more parting,” “Lord, make us more joyful,” and more, depending on the creativity of the leader. These two examples of the appearance of the song in the tune books of the Whites seem to give credence to the theory that the slaves borrowed ideas for the spirituals from the songs that were being sung regularly in the camp meetings. A Negro version can be found in William Francis Allen’s Slave Songs of the United States, 1868, 1929.\n\nThis arrangement of the spiritual was made by Alma Blackmon at the request of the SDAH Committee, on which she served as a member of the tunes committee and the committee on organization.\n\nAlma Montgomery Blackmon was born July 25, 1921, in Washington D.C., to musical SDA parents. She began playing the piano at age 5, and at age 10 she gave her first piano recital in New York City.. From the age of 10 she was organist and choir singer in the First SDA Church, Washington, D.C., then at Ephesus church (now Dupont Park), eventually becoming director of the highly respected Dupont Park Choir. This group has been invited to sing in special events with the National Symphony, with Alma serving as assistant conductor to Robert Shaw and Howard Mitchell. After serving for 30 years in the public schools of the nation’s capital, part of which were as supervisor of early childhood education, she joined the faculty of Oakwood College, Huntsville, Alabama, where she taught in both the English and Music departments. Under her leadership, over a period of 12 years the choral group known as the Aeolians gave some 210 concerts in 29 of the 50 states, the Districts of Columbia, Canada, Romania, England, Scotland, Wales, and the Caribbean. The group was accepted into the programs of the Friendship Ambassadors Foundation, under which they traveled to Romania. Alma herself was one of 57 musicians who went to Russia for a dialogue with government officials, planning for concert exchanges between the two countries. Opportunities to serve the Adventist Church have included five years as a member of the General Conference session held in Cleveland, Ohio; Atlantic City, New Jersey; Dallas, Texas; and New Orleans, Louisiana. Retiring in 1985, Blackmon moved to Memphis, Tennessee, to be near her daughter, a coanchor for NBC news team there. She now has time to enjoy two granddaughters; work on her autobiography, “This Is My Story”; and answer calls to be guest conductor, festival clinician, and leader of seminars in sacred music.\n\nAlma Blackmon has had a long struggle with disease, twice overcoming cancer. He case is an ongoing research study at the National Institutes of Health. All the date amasses in her case year after year continues to be used for the benefit of others.\n\nHer three other arrangements of spirituals in SDA are no. 138, “Rise Up, Shepherd, and Follow”; No. 305, “Give Me Jesus”, and No. 580, “This Little Light of Mine.”",

The firs stanza is addressed to God the Father, the second to God the Son, and the third to God the Holy Ghost, naming the characteristics mentioned by the apostle Paul in the benediction that closes his Second Epistle to the Corinthians: “The grace of the Lord Jesus Chrsit, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen” (2 Cor. 13:14) In the respective stanzas of the hymn, the divine characteristics are alluded to in the following terms: lovingkindness, graciousness, and comforter. The last line ascribes praise to the Trinity, the Three on One.\n\nElizabeth Rundle was born in Tavistock, Devonshire, England, on January 2, 1828, the daughter of a member of Parliament. IN 1851 she married a London barrister, Andrew Paton Charles. She was an accomplished poet, musician, author, and painter, and wrote several historical novels, including ones on the life and times of Luther and John Wesley. She began writing hymns in 1850, translating from German, Latin, and Swedish, together with original ones. She died at Hampstead Heath, near London, on March 28, 1896.\n\nFLEMMING commemorated the composer Friedrich Ferdinand Flemming, who composed it for a male voice choir to words from the Roman poet Horace’s Ode XXII, “Integer Vitae Scelerisque purus” (Upright of Life, Pure From Guilt). Flemming was born in Neuhausen, Germany, 3o miles from Dresden, on February 28, 1778. He qualified as a physician after study at Wittenberg, Jena, Vienna, and Trieste. He practiced in Berlin but cultivated his hobby as a musician, composing many songs for male choir. He died in Berlin on May 27, 1813.",

    "historicalContext": "These words are sometimes attributed to Charles Wesley because the hymn appeared in 1757 on the same tract as one written by him and published by George Whitefield. However, it is not claimed by Wesley, nor does it appear in the older Methodist hymnals, so it remains anonymous. It is a real trinitarian hymn, for the stanzas speak respectively of Father, Son, and Spirit, and then conclude with “One in Three.”\n\nITALIAN HYMN was composed by Felice de Giardini at the special request of Selina, Countess of Huntingdon, for these words. When it was published by Martin Madan (see SDAH 211) in 1769 in his Collection of Psalm and Hymn Tunes Never Published Before, it was named “Hymn to the Trinity.” The same tune is used for SDAH 370, “Chrsit for the World.”\n\nGiardini was born in Turin, Italy, on April 12, 1716; at Milan Cathedral he studied singing, clavier, and harmony. Later he studied violin and played in the opera orchestras in Rome and Naples. He visited Germany in 1748 and about two years later went to London, where he spent more than 30 successful years, teaching, performing, and conducting. From 1784 to 1790 he was in Naples, but he went back to London to start a comic opera compony. When this venture in England failed, he then went to Moscow, where he received a disappointing reception; he died there on December 17, 1796. He composed many operas, 12 violin concertos, much chamber music, and three other tunes in Martin Madan’s Collection. His tune here is variously called MOSCOW, after the city where he died, and ITALIAN HYMN, after the land of his birth.\n\nThe arrangement is by Vicar Earle Copes, who was born August 12, 1921, at Norfolk, Virginia. His B.A. is from Davidson College, North Carolina, his M.S.M. and B.D. from Union Theological Seminary, New York City. After further study at the University of Texas, he has held these positions: minister of music for churches in Texas; professor of organ and church music at Hendrix College, Arkansas, and Cornell College, Iowa; and music editor, Methodist General Board of Education, Nashville. Since 19667 he has been head of the Department of Organ and Church Music at Birmingham Southern College, Alabama, and minister of music at Canterbury Methodist Church, Birmingham. He was the founder and editor of the Methodist magazine Music Ministry. More than 25 anthems and numerous articles in professional journals have come from his pen; he was a special consultant to the committee that produced the Methodist Hymnal, 1964. He also arranged SDAH 89, OLD 113th.",

    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "The Latin original of this six-stanza poem was first found in a ninth-century manuscript in Bern, Switzerland. It was marked “Advent, Evening,” and sung during the season of Advent, but by omitting stanzas 2, 3, and 5, the hymn can be placed in the section on the Trinity. The final stanza is a doxology differing from the original, which was:\n\nTo Him who comes the world to free,\nTo God the Son, all glory be;\nTo God the Father, as is meet,\nThe God the blessed Paraclete.\n\nThis is the first time that praise to the “Father, Son, and Holy Ghost” appears in a hymn as the final stanza. The translation from Latin is by John M. Neale (1818-1866; see Biographies) and has been altered from his original in Collected Poems, 1914, by editors down through the years. The SDAH version is from the Episcopal Hymnal 1940, including the music.\n\nThe melody of CONDITOR ALME (Gracious Creator) is from the treasury of plainsongs, or chants, and may be very similar to the music sung by Jesu and the disciples at the close of the first Lord’s Supper (Mark 14:26). The text they sang was from the Passover Hallel, or Psalm 115 to 118 (More about this may be found on page 672 of the Desire of Ages by Ellen G. White.)\n\nThe tune they used is not known, but a number of traditional tunes have been passed down orally from generation to generation by the Sephardic Jews. Helen Grauman, in Music in My Bible, 1956, quotes an example on page 135 of an ancient melody sung in Psalm 117 by some of the older Eastern Sephardic Jews. The plainsong remains to this day as the only church music that has not been tainted to some degree by secular influences.\n\nAt Rome, prior to the sixth century, the weekly singing of the entire psalter was the basic principle of the offices, or daily services of prayer and reading, including morning and evening prayer, and at five offices during the day. The 150 psalms were sung every week, and the entire Bible read every year. To those in monastic life, “prayer was the highest exercise in which man can engage, the most efficacious of all actions, the chief human agency in the salvation of the world.” And there were 50 of these offices every week! (Edward Dickinson, Music in the History of the Western Church, 1953).\n\nIn England the Sarum rite (plainsong) arose in a group of learned clergy led by Osmund, Bishop of Salisbury Cathedral, in 1085. It contained 119 of the best chants and hymns to that date, including hymns for the festival days of Advent, Nativity, Epiphany, Lent, Easter, Ascension, Pentecost, and Trinity. This collection achieved great popularity in England, rivaling the services in the use at all the other great cathedrals. J.M. Neale took the Latin poem from this collection and translated it into English. It was first published in Hymnal Noted, 1851.\n\nCONDITOR ALME is the tune that has always been associated with this text. Our hymnals today have modernized there plainsongs, giving them the bar lines we are used to. But the plainsong had no beat; it simply used the rhythms and accents of expressive speaking. The early ones were very simple, almost a monotone, with one syllable of the text to a note. But creativity will have its way, and little by little the melodies took on the beauty of interval skips and slurs on one syllable, with the expression that followed the architecture of that melody line.\n\nA harmonized chant is SDAH 665, “All Things Come of Thee,” which the SDAH Committee Brough back from F.E. Belden’s Chrsit in Song, 1908.\n\nThe arranger of CONDITOR ALME, Charles Winfred Douglas, was born February 15, 1867, at Oswego, New York. While attending Syracuse University, he was organist at St. Paul’s Cathedral, and after graduation was organist-choirmaster at Church of Zion and St. Timothy’s Church, New York City. Then came theological study at St. Andrew’s Divinity School, Syracuse, and a position as curate of the Church of the Redeemer, New York, City. A severe lung illness forced him to move west; he settled near Denver at Evergreen, Colorado, serving in several Episcopal churches. During two periods he studied church music and plain chant in Europe, particularly with the Benedictines on the Isle of Wight.\n\nHe is recognized as an outstanding authority in this field. A member of many learned societies, he was awarded the D.Mus. degree from Nashota, Seminary, Wisconsin, in 1917. An expert in Indian affairs and education, he was named “Tall Pine Tree” by a Hopi pueblo. In 1936 he was Hale lecturer at Seabury-Western Seminary, Evanston, Illinois, the lectures being published as Church Music in History and Practice, 1937. A scholar, researcher, linguist, poet, composer, and editor, he was the preeminent Episcopal musician of his time. Douglas edited Hymnal 1940, finishing the final proofs the day before his death on January 18, 1944. His extensive library of liturgy and church music is now at Washington Cathedral, Washington, D.C.\n\nHe spent his energetic, productive life in helping people learn how to praise God in a more beautiful and meaningful way. Concluding his Hale lectures, he said, “Still the Holy Spirit moves in the heart of men to create new songs consonant with the old. We can thank God that He has led us so far toward a pure worship where the prayer will sing and the music will; where each member of the mystical body of Christ will be taken up into the heavenly worship and actively participate in it with heart and mind and voice.”\n\nSDAH 136, IN DULCE JUBILO, and SDAH 576, MORNING SONG, are also arranged by Douglas.",

    "historicalContext": "This hymn of four stanzas was written especially for Trinity Sunday by Reginald Heber (1783-1826; see on SDAH 47). It is a metrical paraphrase of Revelation 4:8-11: “They rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come…. The four and twenty elders fall down before him… and cast their crowns before the throne, saying, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things.”\n\nNICAEA was composed especially for these words by John Bacchus Dykes (1823-1876; see Biographies) in 1861. It is named after the ancient city (now Iznik) in Asia Minor where a church council of 300 bishops assembled in A.D. 325. They had met to decide the controversy regarding the Godhead and the position of Christ. Arius maintained the Jesus was not equal to, nor of the same substance, as God the Father. His doctrine was condemned by the council, and the teaching of Athanasius supporting the Trinity and the unity of the Godhead was incorporated as an article as an article of the faith. The words of the last line recall the Nicene Creed, which Dykes obviously supported by his choice of tune name.",

    "historicalContext": "Frances Ridley Havergal (1836-1879) wrote this hymn at Leamington, England, in 1874, titled “Perfect Peace—In Illness” and printed it in her Loyal Responses, 1878. It was based on Isaiah 48:18: “Then had thy peace been as a river.” The first half of the third stanza has been altered somewhat, as will be seen when compared with the original, which was:\n\nEvery joy or trial\nFalleth from above\nTraced upon the dial\nBy the Sun of Love\n\nWYE VALLEY is the name of a beautiful river that, in its lower reaches, separates England and Wales. Tintern Abbey ruins, and the bend at Symonds Yat in Particular, are examples of its scenic attractions. It is an appropriate name for this tune, written for a “river glorious.” The tune was composed especially for this text and published in Mountain’s Hymns od Consecration and Faith, 1876, and bore the title “Perfect Peace.”\n\nJames Mountain was born on July 16, 1844, at Leeds, Yorkshire, England, and educated for the ministry of the Countess of Huntingdon’s Connexion at Rotherham College, Nottingham Institute, and Cheshunt College. After a short while as pastor of Great Marlow in Buckinghamshire he suffered a health breakdown, and for a time did some traveling and studying at Heidelberg and Tübingen, Germany.\n\nWhen Dwight L. Moody and Ira D. Sankey visited England, Mountain caught the evangelistic spirit and conducted several “missions” in England and other lands from 1874 to 1889. In 1897 he accepted the Baptist view of baptism and founded the Tunbridge Wells Baptist Church, which he pastored till his retirement, and where he died June 27, 1933.\n\nMountain wrote religious books, articles, and hymn texts, but is best known for his hymn tunes. The Keswick Hymn-Book, c.1940, contained 14 of his tunes, many of which show a decided leaning toward the gospel song style of Ira Sankey (see SDAH 208)\n\nNoticeable in the melody are the many pairs of repeated notes, which accounted for 72 percent of the song!",

    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "This hymn is summarized by the verse “The Son of God, who loved me” (Gal. 2:20). Both words and music were written by George Beverly Shea, who was born February 1, 1909, the fourth of eight children, to a Wesleyan Methodist minister and his wife in Winchester, Ontario, Canada. They named him after the famous preacher, Beverly Carradine. At age 5 he showed a keen interest in music, and would watch his mother’s hands move over the piano keys. Soon he was picking out melodies on the keyboard.\n\nAfter a move to Houghton, New York, a severe tonsil infection kept George out of school, and his mother taught him the third and fourth grades. He learned to play the harmonica and violin, but was too shy to play for anyone but his mother. The high school years were spent at Annesley College, where he sang bass in a male quarter. In 1928, at age 19, George entered Houghton College, played violin in the orchestra, and sand bass in the glee club, but he stayed for one only one year of training.\n\nWhen the family moved to Jersey City, he took a job as assistant to the medical examiner for the MONY Insurance Company in New York City. He studied voice privately, and sand on Sundays in his father’s church. He won an audition to sing on Fred Allen’s radio show, presenting “Go Down, Moses,” but did not win the prize. A big turning point in his life came when he won an audition to be one of the famous Lynn Murray Singers, but he turned it down because of questionable language in a song they asked him to sing. In his book Then Sings My Soul he says: “Some years earlier I had vowed to let God open the doorknob in sight. I reasoned, and still do, that if God had some new direction in mind, He would speak to me about it— if I made it a point to listen. It is a principle I have employed throughout life.”\n\nFor five years Shea served at WMBI, the radio voice of Moody Bible Institute, Chicago. His varied responsibilities included announcing, newscasting, script writing, hosting a classical music program, administration, and of course, singing. In 1943 a big opportunity came, and he resigned his job at WMBI to take over the soloist job on Club Time, a 15-minute daily broadcast of hymns on WCFL, sponsored by Club Aluminum. Don Hustad was the organist, and Jack Halloran choir director. George also sang on Songs in the Night, a broadcast from Billy Graham’s Village Church, Western Springs, Illinois, which was the beginning of their long associating together. He moved from Chicago and bought a little house in Western Springs, where he and his wife, Erna, have lived ever since. He studied voice in Chicago with Gino Monaco, who was able to help him with diction and interpretation.\n\nThe first big Billy Graham crusade came in November 1947 in Charlotte, North Carolina. For many years Shea would sing for the meetings, then fly back to his radio commitments in Chicago, making the round trip each week. He once said that O’Hare Airport was almost like his second home! It was after the Los Angeles crusade when Stuart Hamblen (see SDAH 632) was converted that the Billy Graham crusades gained worldwide notoriety. Huge crowds filled arenas and football stadiums,  and the crusades went on radio and television. In the spring of 1951 Shea made his first record for RCA with the Hugo Winterhalter Orchestra. A later recording, Southern Favorites, with the Anita Kerr Singers, won a Grammy Award. In 1966 he was given a gold record by RCA, in recognition of the fact that his long-play albums had reached a sale of more that 1 million copies.\n\nIn writing the introduction for Shea’s autobiography, Billy Graham said, “The thing that impressed me most about Bev from the very beginning of our long association was the life he lived behind the scened. His humility was genuine. His walk with God was sincere. He really meant what he sang! … He sings a sermon… He is in a class by himself when it comes to worshipful singing.”\n\nAt this writing George Beverly Shea is 77 and still traveling, singing with Billy Graham, going to witness wherever the Lord leads. On a recent appearance for George Schuler at the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, Califorina, his voice was still sure and the song, a simple one, aimed straight at people’s hearts.\n\nShea also composed the tune for SDAH 327, “I’d Rather Have Jesus.”",

    "historicalContext": "George Matheson began to lose his sight before he was a year old; at 17 he was almost completely blind. A brilliant student in spite of this handicap, he gained his B.A. at the University of Glasgow in 1861, his M.A. in 1862, and a B.D. in 1866. He was ordained in 1868 and appointed as parish minister in Innellan, Argyll, on the Firth of Clyde. In the manse there on June 6, 1882, he was, he says, “Suffering from extreme mental distress and the hymn was the fruit of pain.” This pain was not caused by a broken engagement, as that had happened about 20 years earlier, but it might have been a bereavement or his concern over the inroads that Darwinism was making in the church.\n\nThis hymn was written very quickly in the space of minutes only, as though it was dictated by an inward voice, and not revised or retouched afterwards. The one exception that was later suggester and agreed upon was in the third stanza where “I climb” now reads “I trace. In spite of the author’s statement that it was written in 1882, it appeared in the Church of Scotland magazine Life and Work in January 1882, so June 1881 may be the correct date. The words, as in most of Matheson’s poems, are not easy to understand on the first reading, but become clearer after much thought and meditation. The structure of this hymn is very apparent, however, as the poet uses metaphors for a God who will not leave His child forsaken: first Love, then Light, then Joy, then the Cross.\n\nGeorge Matheson was born in Glasgow in March 27, 1842. He ministered at Innellan from 1868 to 1886, when he was transferred to St. Bernard’s, Edinburgh. He served there until he resigned, because of ill health, in 1899. He was honored with a D.D. from Edinburgh University in 1879 and with a L.L.D. from Aberdeen University in 1902. He died at North Berwick, Lothian, Scotland, on August 28, 1906. He also wrote SDAH 568, “Make Me a Captive Lord.”\n\nST. MARGARET was likewise composed very rapidly; its composer, Albert Lister Peace, said that “the ink of the first note was hardly dry when I had finished the tune.” He was requested to supply a tune for Matheson’s words in the uncommon meter 8.8.8.8.6. (there are no others in SDAH!); in accordance with his usual practice, he carried with him the words of the hymn, ready to jot down the melody as inspiration came to him. He was sitting on the sand on the isle of Arran reading the words when this melody came into his mind. The name of the tune commemorates a queen of Scotland who was a benefactress to the church, thus making this hymn a truly Scottish one.\n\nPeace was born in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, on January 26, 1844. When only 9 years old, he was organist at the Parish Church at Holmfirth, five miles south of his birthplace. He studied at the University of Oxford, gaining a B.Mus. degree in 1870 and D.Mus. Im 1875. After filling several minor posts as organist until 1879, he was appointed organist at Glasgow Cathedral, where he remained until 1897. Then he was called to be organist at St. George’s Hall in Liverpool. He wrote much church and organ music and edited two hymnals. He died in Blundellsans, near Liverpool, on March 14, 1912. In his time he was recognized as one of Britain’s greatest organists.",

    "historicalContext": "This hymn has been characterized as “a rhapsody of gratitude for the love of God.” It first appeared in three eight-line stanza in Pilgrim Hymnal, 1904, and has since been shortened by editors, and altered somewhat to change archaic language.\n\nOscar Clute was born March 11, 1837, in Bethlehem, New York; he graduated from Michigan Agricultural College, staying there to teach mathematics for several years. Feeling a call to the ministry, he studied at Meadville Theological Seminary and for 20 years was pastor of Unitarian churches in New Jersey, Iowa, and California. In his later life, he was a successful college president of Michigan Agricultural College (now Michigan State), and Florida Agricultural College. At a time when scientific theories seemed to threaten men’s loyalties to spiritual things, Clute, with his scientific knowledge and deep religious convictions, had a great influence for good. He exhibited a lifelong interest in the entrance of woman into the ministry. After five years of retirement in California, he died January January 27, 1902.\n\nGordon Young is recognized as one of the most brilliant organist and prolific composers or organa and choral music of our times, having more than 800 compositions appearing in the catalog of some 40 American and British publishers. His anthems and organ works are performed weekly in churches from coast to coast. Born October 15, 1919, in McPherson, Kansas, he graduated from Southwestern College, Winfield, Kansas, and went to Curtis Institute of Music, Philadelphia. Later organ study was with Joseph Bonnet in Paris and American organist Alexander McCurdy. He has served as organist-choirmaster in large churches in Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Detroit, Michigan, and continues to write music that is a blessing to Christians all over the world. An honorary D.Mus. was conferred on him by Southwestern College.\n\nWhile minister of music at Vallejo Drive Seventh-day Adventist Church, Glendale, California, in the 1960s, Wayne Hooper (1920-;see Biographies) used and enjoyed Young’s anthem, “O Love of God Most Full” (unfortunately, now out of print.) Wanting to have this beautiful, simple melody in SDAH, he asked for and received permission from Young to condense the anthem into a hymn of two scores. When asked to name his tune, Gordon Young wrote: “I enjoy hearing George Vandeman on television [the It is Written program], so why not name the tune VANDEMAN?”",

    "historicalContext": "The version here printed of this old familiar children’s hymn is from The Memonite Hymnal, 1969, and information about it comes from that book and its companion volume. The words were written by August Diedrich Rische, who was born in Minden, near Hanover, Northwest Germany, in 1819. He studied theology at the University of Halle, near Leipzig. In 1844 he became a private tutor and in 1851 was pastor in Schwindendorf, in the state of Mecklenburg. In 1900 he was a member of the bishop’s consistory court in Ludwigslust, also in Mecklenburg. For 10 years he was editor of Sunday papers in Mecklenburg and published song collections. He died in 1906.\n\nThe hymn appeared in a German Lutheran hymnal in America in 1873. After translation into English, it was used in only three successive Mennonite hymnals. The composition paraphrase was made and appeared in The Youth Hymnary, 1956, and the The Hymn Book, 1969 (Canadian Mennonite Brethren).\n\nIt is thought that the early source of the tune was a folk song. The tune name GOTT IST DIE LIEBE comes from the first line of the German original. In Deutscher Liederhort authors Erk and Boehme list a version of this song. The German hymnal Gesangbuch Der Mennoniten, 1965, indicates “Meiningen,” 1840, but the editors of that book give no further documentation.",

    "author": "Horatius Bonar",
    "authorBirthDeath": "1808–1889",
    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": 1861,
    "historicalContext": "These words appear in Hymns of Faith and Hope, 2nd Series, 1861, by Horatius Bonar. The hymn was entitled “The Love of God” and consisted of 10 stanzas, of which we have Nos. 1, 2, 6, 9, and 10.\n\nHoratius Bonar was born on December 19, 1808, in Edinburgh, Scotland. At the university in Edinburg he came under the influence of Thomas Chalmers and Edward Irving. The former inspired him to become a minister of the gospel, and the latter, to study the prophecies of the Bible. Bonar began his ministerial duties in the church of St. John’s, Leith, in 1833, in one of the slum areas of Edinburg. Since he found the children bored with singing psalms, he began to write original hymns to attract their interest. The result was a great interest in the Sunday school. At the time, psalm singing was the only form allowed in the Presbyterian Church. Bonar was ordained a minister of the Church of Scotland in 1837 and appointed to Kelso. At the disruption in 1843, when the Scottish Church split, he followed his teacher Chalmers into the newly formed Free Church of Scotland, remaining at Kelso. In 1853 he received the D.D. degree from the University of Aberdeen. In 1866 he was transferred to the Chalmers Memorial Church in Edinburgh, where he remained for 21 years, until his retirement. He was appointed moderator of the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland in 1883, and died at Edinburgh on July 31, 1889. He was noted for his diligence, his piety, his visiting, and his prayer life. He wrote about 600 hymns, 60 translations of the psalms, and hundreds of tracts. His hymns are subjective and appealing; his purpose was to fill them with the love and light of Christ. During the revival of 1873-1874 in Scotland under Moody and Sankey, he wrote hymns, especially for Sankey. He published several hymn collections, among them Songs of the Wilderness, 1843 and 1844; Bible HymnBook, 1845; and Hymns of Faith and Hope, 1857, 1861, and 1866. Bonar was a devout student of prophecy and edited the Quarterly Journal of Prophecy from its inception in 1848 until its cessation in 1873, and regularly contributed a new hymn to its pages. He believed in the imminent return of the Lord Jesus Christ, which is evidently in many of his hymns.\n\nHis other contributions to SDAH are Nos. 217, “The Church Haas Waited Long”; 298, “I Lay My Sins on Jesus”; and 465, “I Heard the Voice of Jesus.”\n\nOMBERSLEY was composed in 1872 by William Henry Gladstone, the eldest son of William Ewart Gladstone, the Grand Old Man of English politics, four times prime minister of Great Britain. He was born on June 3, 1840, on the family estate in the castle of Hawarden, Flintshire, north Wales, and educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford. He was a classical scholar and an accomplished guitarist, but chose to follow a career in politics, being an elected member of Parliament for Chester for three years, for Whitby for 12 years, and for East Worcestershire for five years. He composed 10 hymn tunes and chants, anthems, and organ voluntaries; also, he edited A Selection of Hymns and Tunes, 1882. OMBERSLEY first appeared in The Hymnary, 1872, but was set to other words. It is named after a village near Worcester in the constituency that Gladstone later represented in the House of Commons. Gladstone died in Westminster, London, on July 4, 1891.",

    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "In a letter dated August 23, 1985, Rev. R.B.Y. Scott, author of this text, says, “Yes, there was an unusual circumstance connected with the hymn lyric ‘O World of God.’The committee on the 1971 Hymn Book wanted to use Parry’s tune JERUSALEM, but William Blake’s (1757-1827) words to which it was set were unsuitable. They asked me to try my hand at a lyric in this meter. I did so, and it was accepted and printed.”\n\nRobert Balgarnie Young Scott was born July 16, 1899, and his early education was in Toronto, Canada. At the University of Toronto he earned the B.A. in 1922, M.A. in 1924, and Ph.D. in 1928. Union College of Toronto conferred the B.D. and an honorary D.D. on him. He was professor of Old Testament literature at Union College of British Columbia and Union Theological College of Montreal; he was on the faculty of divinity, and for two years he was dean at McGill University; professor of religion, chairman, and professor emeritus of Princeton University. During World War I, he served as a wireless operator and chaplain in the Royal Air Force.\n\nThe Province of Quebec awarded him the Literary Prize in 1946; he won the Canadian Council of Churches Prize for a centennial hymn in 1967 and is the author of 10 hymns published in more than 30 hymnbooks internationally. He has authored a number of theological books, contributed to reference works, and published magazine articles. A world-class scholar, he is recognized by these learned organizations: fellow, Royal Society of Canada; fellow, American Learned Societies; president, 1960, Society of Biblical Literature; secretary-treasurer, 1932-1939, president, 1972, Canadian Society for Biblical Studies; Society of Old Testament Study (United Kingdom), 1948-1974; International Congress of Old Testament Studies, 1952-1965. Now retired, he lived in Toronto and is almost blind.\n\nReading and singing these stirring words, he is led to feel that here is a man who, through his lifelong study of the Bible, has developed a strong faith in God’s eternal, loving purpose for mankind. “A central moment when there rose a cross upon a cruel hill” and “The promise of God’s triumph is His coming in a Son of Man” reveal the ultimate solution for our world “of man where life is lived, so strangely mingling joy and pain, so full of evil.”\n\nThe tune JERUSALEM, by Charles H. H. Parry (1848-1918; see SDAH 20), the original of which appears in Songs of Praise,1931, is for unison voices with organ accompaniment. The arrangement here printed by Gordon Jacob is somewhat simplified, but still maintains the power and dignity of this tune about which Erik Routley says, “Parry’s supreme congregation achievements was, obviously, JERUSALEM… written for a poem that is not in any sense a hymn. This is one of the half dozen tunes which every Englishman knows, and in a ruggedly sentimental fashion, loves. It has been referred to as the English national anthem (there is no other), and if it is to be included in the ranks of national songs, then it is the finest piece of music, by a long way, to have that honor. But looked at as a piece of melodic engineering, it is flawless in its judgement of what ordinary people are glad to sing… All the way it enables people to make great music, as if that were the most natural thing in the world.”\n\nGordon Percival Septimus Jacob was born July 5, 1895, at Norwood, London, England. He enlisted in the armed forces at age 19 and was a prisoner of war from 1917 to 1918. At the Royal College of Music he studied under Charles V. Stanford (see SDAH 32), Herbert Howells (see SDAH 5), and Sir Adrian Boult. In 1926 he was appointed professor fo composition at the same school. A brilliant teacher, he is known for his book Orchestral Technique, 1931, and for orchestral and vocal works. He lives in retirement at Saffron Waldon, Essex.\n\nThese stanzas of “Jerusalem,” first appearing in the preface to William Blake’s Milton, were the inspiration for Parry’s tune:\n\nAnd did those feet in ancient time\nWalk upon England’s mountains green?\nAnd was the holy Lamb of God\nOn England’s pleasant pastures seen?\nAnd did the Countenance Divine\nShine forth upon our clouded hills?\nAnd was Jerusalem builded here\nAmong those dark Satanic Mills?\nBring me my bow of burning gold!\nBring me my arrows of desire!\nBring me my spear! Oh clouds, unfold!\nBring me my chariot of fire!\nI will not cease from mental fight\nNor shall my sword sleep in my hand,\nTill we have built Jerusalem\nIn England’s green and pleasant land.\n\nIt was first sung at Royal Albert Hall in a service of thanksgiving in the middle of World War II, when woman’s suffrage had just passed in the House of Commons. It has been made famous in America by the film Chariots of Fire, at the end of which it is sung by choir and congregation in a magnificent cathedral.\n\nAnother great poet, Robert Bridges (see SDAH 5), suggested that Parry write “suitable simple music to Blake’s stanza— music that an audience could take up and join in.” He did so, and gave the manuscript to Sir Walford Davies (see SDAH 641) with “Here’s a tune for you, old chap. Do what you like with it.” Davies wrote a letter in 1927 to the London Times about it: “Sir Hubert Parry gave me the manuscript of this setting o Blake’s ‘Jerusalem’ one memorable morning in 1916… We looked at it long together in his room at the Royal College of Music, and I recall vividly his unwonted happiness over it… I copyrighted it in the composer’s name and published it in 1916. We needed it for the men [soldiers] at that time. It is indeed good to know that Dame Millicent Fawcett needed and had asked for it for the women too. I know Dr. Bridges specifically wanted every one of us to sing it, and this is happily coming true.”",

    "historicalContext": "Under the title “Hymn of Love,” this text appeared in The Hymns and Ballads of Fred Pratt Green, Hope Publishing Company, 1982. Basing it on the first six versed of the love chapter 1, 1 Corinthians 13, Pratt Green (1903-;see Biographies) wrote it with the tune DEVOTION (composed by the late Edwin Quick, formerly choirmaster of Westborough Methodist Church, Scarborough, England) in mind. Pratt Green, a Methodist minister, is recognized as one of the British poets responsible for and “explosion” of hymns in contemporary language written in Britain in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nJames Bingham (1945-; see SDAH 54) a member of the SDAH Committee, writes: “When I read the words ‘Though I speak with tongues,’ by Fred Pratt Green, I was immediately struck with their power and beauty. The meter of the hymn precluded and familiar tune being given it, so the only alternative was to create a new one. The long meter and the sentiments of the text seemed to dictate fairly long phrases, which characterizes the first four lines. Care was taken not to make these lines detract from climatic thought: ‘Without love I am no better.’ At this point the music takes a more triumphant note, while the application of love— the last two lines—becomes more reflective again.\n\n“The tune name JANELLE is taken from my wife’s name, Janelle Diane (Decker) Bingham. I chose it because she, more than any other, has taught me the meaning of earthly love, giving me a clearer understanding of the selfless heavenly love of Jesus. At the time of composing this music, she was working up to 15 hours a day, six days a week, to put me through my doctoral studies. I had planned to open the new hymnal and let her see her name there for the first time. However, my Sunday church, the First Congregational church of Benton Harbor, Michigan, wanted to premier the work. My wife came to that performance, and when handed a bulletin she was astonished to find her name attached to the tune. The minister singled her out, honoring her for her dedication to me and her tireless work that enabled me to obtain my doctorate. It was a very moving occasion!”\n\nBingham also composed the tunes for SDAH 54, PHOS HILARON; SDAH 102, YOU YANGS; and SDAH 148, INFINITE LOVE.",

    "historicalContext": "Isaac Watts (1674–1748) broke away from the metrical versions of the psalms. These adhered very strictly to the wording of the Old Testament and, consequently, in many cases produced awkward, clumsy lines. Watts made free paraphrases, skillfully using the main thought of the psalm and omitting references that were not germane in Christian times. This hymn is his paraphrase of Psalm 100; it could be compared profitably with William Kethe’s metrical version of the same psalm (see SDAH 16).\n\nJohn Wesley, who objected to other writers tinkering with his hymns and those of his brother Charles, wisely omitted the initial patriotic stanza and changed the first two lines of the second stanza (first in SDAH) from:\n\nNations attend before His throne,\nWith solemn fear, with sacred joy.\n\nDUKE STREET is listed as anonymous in Henry Boyd’s Select Collection of Psalm and Hymn Tunes, 1793, where it bears the name ADDISON’S 19TH PSALM. But in William Dixon’s Euphonia, c. 1805, it is called DUKE STREETand credited to John Hatton. The name is a street where the composer’s home was located.\n\nLittle is known about John Hatton. Born about 1710 at Warrington, Lancashire, he lived at St. Helen’s in the township of Windle, England, on the street after which he named the tune. Some think he was killed in a stagecoach accident; the Presbyterian Church of St. Helen’s records the preaching of his funeral sermon on December 13, 1793. If he wrote other music, it has not survived, but this one, which marches vigorously up and down the scale, is in nearly every hymnal and often is set to several texts. SDAH uses it again for No. 227, “Jesus Shall Reign,” in which Melvin West (see Biographies) has arranged it for unison voices.",

    "yearWritten": 1833,
    "historicalContext": "Robert Grant was impressed to write this hymn based on Psalm 104 after reading William Kethe’s (see SDAH 16) quaint rendering of this psalm. It is not strictly a paraphrase, bu several verses are followed quite closely. The hymn first appeared in 1833 in Edward Bickersteth’s Christian Psalmody and posthumously in Grant’s Sacred Poems, 1839. It was originally entitled “Glory and Goodness of God” and had three stanzas, each of eight lines.\n\nRobert Grant was born in Bengal, India, in 1779 and went to England for his education. He graduated from Magdalen College, Cambridge, with a B.S. in 1801 and an M.A. in 1804. He studied law and was called to the bar in 1807. Becoming a member of Parliament in 1818, he was made a privy counselor in 1831 and judge advocate-general in 1832. In 1834 he was knighted and appointed governor of Bombay. He died at Dalpoorie in western India on July 9, 1838.\n\nLYONS was probably composed in 1770 by Johann Michael Haydn, younger brother of the more famous Franz Joseph (see SDAH 96). He was born in Rohrau, Austria, near Vienna, on September 14, 1737. He was a chorister and deputy organist at St. Stephen’s Cathedral in Vienna from 1745 to 1755. In 1757 he was appointed kapellmeister to Count Firmian, the bishop at Grosswardein; five years later the archbishop of Salzburg appointed him musical director and concertmaster. He served as organist at the churches of Holy Trinity and St. Peter. Despite tempting offers from Vienna, Haydn remained in Salzburg. He composed a great deal of music, including about 300 pieces for the church, all of which were initialed O.a.m.D.Gl., “Omnia ad moharem Del Gloriam” (All for the Greater Glory of God). SDAH 599, GREENLAND, is one of his compositions. He died at Salzburg on August 10, 1806.\n\nThe arrangement was made by William Gardiner (1770-1835; see SDAH 177) and appeared in his Sacred Melodies II, 1815. Gardiner also arranged the tune GARDINER, which is used for SDAH 177, 355, and 376.",

    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "The tune of this hymn was composed before the words and had its origin in a request from the czar of Russia, Nicholas I, for a national anthem for his own country, to replace the tune of the British national anthem, “God Save the King.” The czar had just visited Austria and Prussia and asked Alexis Feodorovich Lvov, who had accompanied him on his journey, to write a tune for an anthem. In November 1833, on returning to his quarters late one night, Lvov wrote out a tune on the spur of the moment and asked a friend to supply some words. The emperor, the empress, and the grand duke Michael went to the court chapel the next morning and heard the new anthem played by the orchestra and sung by the choir, together and separately. The emperor expressed his warm approval and adopted the new hymn, “God Save the Czar,” as the Russian national anthem.\n\nThe tune first appeared as an English hymn tune in John Pyke Hullah’s (1812–1884) Part Music, 1842, to the words “God the all terrible! King who ordainest,” written by Henry Fothergill Chorley and entitled “In Time of War.” The hymn was imitated by John Ellerton (1826–1893; see SDAH 56) in his Select Hymns for Church and Home, 1871. The present SDAH hymn is a composite one.\n\nLvov was born in Tallinn, Estonia, on June 5, 1798, and studied music as an engineer and joined the army in 1818, ultimately becoming a major-general adjutant to the czar; he retired in 1836. He then succeeded his father as musical director in the imperial chapel. He was an excellent violinist and led a famous string quartet that visited many places in Europe. Lvov composed several operas, a string quartet, a violin concerto, violin fantasias, and choral music. He also edited a collection of old Russian chants. He retired in 1867 because of deafness and died on December 28, 1870, at Romanovo, near Kovno (Kaunas), in Lithuania.\n\nChorley was born on December 15, 1808, at Blackley Hurst, a country house near Wigan, Lancashire, and was a Quaker. He was educated at the Royal Institution in Liverpool and after a short time in business discovered his literary talent. He joined the staff of the London Athenaeum in 1831 and remained there for more than 35 years as a writer, musical editor, and book reviewer. His visit to Germany in 1849 led to a lasting friendship with Mendelssohn, with whom he entered into considerable correspondence, and also an acquaintance with Chopin. He also wrote novels and many songs for opera and was musical critic for The Times daily newspaper. He died on February 15, 1872, at Westminster, London.",

    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "The author and the composer of this hymn lived almost contemporaneously, and both died at age 53. First published in the original edition of Hymns Ancient and Modern, 1861, it bore the caption: “For those at sea. These see the works of the Lord, and His wonders in the deep” (Ps. 107:24). It was altered several times, once by the author, but except for a couple of small changes (“Our brethren” in stanza 4 becomes “All trav’lers”), SDAH uses the original version as found in the Episcopal Hymnal 1940. It has come to be known as the Navy Hymn and is sung regularly at the U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland.\n\nWilliam Whiting was born November 1, 1825; his father was a grocer in Kensington, London. At age 16 William entered the Winchester Training Institute; the very next year his musical ability got him the job of master of the Winchester College Chorister’s School, a 16-boy choir whose tradition went all the way back to 1382. Besides singing in the chapel, the boys waited tables for the college boys in the dining hall, wearing uniforms with swallowtail coats. Whiting stayed on as leader of this group for 35 years until his death, June 3, 1878.\n\nTwo collections of his poetry were published, but he is remembered solely for this hymn, which has found its way into countless hymnals. It is not so strange that a prayer for safety on the sea should come from an inland boys’ school. Winchester is only 12 miles from England’s second greatest port, Southampton, and 22 miles away is the great naval base at Portsmouth. Bailey, in The Gospel in Hymns, says: “I have crossed the Atlantic 49 times, and to the best of my recollection this hymn was sung at morning prayer every Sunday we were at sea under the British flag.”\n\nMELITA is the Roman version of Malta, the island where Paul was shipwrecked while traveling as a prisoner to Rome (read the story in Acts 27 and 28). This tune was written by John B. Dykes (1823–1876; see Biographies) especially for Whiting’s words and was published with them. It has been one of those happy marriages of text and tune that is universally considered permanent. Dykes’s style, which greatly influenced later hymn tune composers, is characterized by interesting melodic parts for alto, tenor, and bass; and the use of chromaticism, considered by some to be too romantic but by others to be expressive and beautiful.",

    "historicalContext": "This hymn is the result of a long series of translations and arrangements. The original was in Swedish, written by Carl Boberg (1859-1940), preacher, member of the Swedish Parliament, and editor of the weekly Sanningsvittnet (Witness of Truth). He wrote it one evening in 1888 while contemplating the power of God in the beautiful things of nature all around him. Published in several magazines, it traveled to Germany and was translated there in 1907 as “Wie gross bist Du” (How Great Thou Art). In 1912 it found its way to Russia, where the Russian translation by Ivan Prokhanoff caught the attention of Methodist missionary Stuart K. Hine (1899-). Hine used it in his evangelistic work in Russia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania before making the English translation of the first three stanzas from the Russian. (At this time he had no idea that the original was Swedish.)\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II Hine returned to England and there wrote stanza 4 in 1948. The idea for this stanza was suggested to him by a question the Polish refugees were asking, “When are we going home?” This he published, together with the Russian version, in a gospel magazine, Grace and Peace, in 1949, copies of which went to missionaries all over the world. One of these copies fell into the hand of George Beverly Shea (see SDAH 75), who popularized it by repeated performances in the Billy Graham crusades. Shea says that in the 1957 New York crusade “the choir joined me in singing it 93 times! It became a keynote of praise each evening.”\n\nIn 1925 an English translation, “O Mighty God,” had been made by American E. Gustav Johnson. It has appeared in several hymnbooks but has never achieved a significant following.\n\nO STORE GUD (O Great God) is a Swedish folk melody, first published in Sanningsvittnet, 1891, the magazine edited by Boberg noted above. Hine says, “The harmony I wrote from memory, and despite a few harmonic inaccuracies, is essentially that in use in nine languages. I have never seen the original Swedish music.”\n\nThe harmonic arrangement used in SDAH is that owned by Manna Music, Inc., for use in North America. Hine still owns the rights for overseas use. SDAH was requested not to use the tune name O STORE GUD at the head of the hymn, even though this is the name used in most books. The committee was also asked not to print the name of Carl Boberg as the author of the Swedish original poem, since Hine’s translation from the Russian is essentially a totally new work. We don’t know who borrowed from whom, but the first melodic phrase in the refrain is note for note the same as the Hawaiian goodbye song “Aloha Oe.”\n\nStuart Wesley Keene Hine was born July 25, 1899, at London, where he attended the Coopers Company School. He took the entrance exam at Oxford University, but did not enter the university. After serving in the British Army in France during World War I, he and his wife went as Methodist missionaries, serving from 1923 to 1939 in Poland, Russia, Czechoslovakia, and Romania. In the years of World War II he worked among displaced persons in Britain. He now lives in retirement in Somerset, continuing to help produce evangelistic literature. In 1958 he added these two stanzas to the hymn:\n\nOh, when I see ungrateful man defiling\nThis bounteous earth, God’s gifts so good and great;\nIn foolish pride God’s holy name reviling\nAnd yet, in grace, His wrath and judgment wait:\n\nWhen burdens press, and seem beyond endurance,\nBowed down with grief, to Him I lift my face;\nAnd then in love He brings me sweet assurance:\n“My child! For thee sufficient is My grace.”\n\nMethodist Hymnal, 1964, was the first major hymnal to use “How Great Thou Art.” Since then, nearly all editors are recognizing the universal appeal of this hymn in praise of the greatness of God.",

    "historicalContext": "This hymn by Frederik Kaan (1929– ) was published in 1968 and entitled “The First and Final Word,”which are the last words of the last line of the hymn. It encompasses the fact that the Hebrew word dabar not only means “word” but also can be translated as “deed”; in other words, as the author says, “Whenever God speaks, things happen.” In the New Testament, the Greek word logos is generally translated “word,” but it is also given as “work” or “actions”(not “men and nations”). The text uses Scripture references. For example: “God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son” (Heb. 1:1, 2). “For He spake, and it was done; He commanded and it stood fast” (Ps. 33:9). These are statements that show cause and effect as a logical process of speech and action.\n\nThe tune NEW MALDEN was composed in 1971 by David Wyn McCarthy, who was born April 2, 1931, in a small mining village near Wrexham in Wales. He studied English and theology at Cambridge University and attained the Licentiate of the Royal Academy of Music. He taught English at the Methodist boarding school for boys near Bradford and, beginning in 1960, was the director of music there as well as being a Methodist local preacher. The tune was specially written for these words of Fred Kaan to be used in McCarthy’s school chapel service. However, it was first printed in 1971 in Fred Pratt Green’s Twenty-Six Hymns in a hymn entitled “A Mature Faith.” The tune derives its name from a suburb of Greater London, New Malden, which is in Surrey, about 10 miles southwest of the city center. It was the home of John Farmer and honors his name and the work he did in initiating the music weekend courses of “Youth Makes Music.” It is worthy of note that the melody of the third and fourth lines is exactly a third above the melody of the first two lines, with the exception of the last note.",

    "historicalContext": "These words by Isaac Watts (1674–1748) appear in his Divine Songs for Children, 1715, under the title “Praise for Creation and Providence.” The thoughts are taken from the Creation account in Genesis 1 and the Creation psalm, Psalm 104. Originally there were eight stanzas of four lines each; the first six were changed to three stanzas of eight lines, as appears in SDAH.\n\nVARINA is a woman’s name, but we know of no special reason for its being chosen for this tune. It is one of Root’s best-known tunes, first appearing in The Sabbath Bell, 1856, where it was said to be “From Rink, by G.F.R.” This is Heinrich Rink; the tune appeared under his name in Philip Phillips’ Metrical Tune Book, 1898. This seems to indicate that Root arranged it from an earlier tune by Rink.\n\nGeorge Frederick Root was born August 30, 1820, in Sheffield, Massachusetts, to a family who believed in training their children to habits of industry, or work ethic, and teaching them the strictest morality and religion. As a small boy he did not sing much but made up for it in learning to play every possible instrument. At age 13 he could play 13 instruments! He dreamed of making music his life, but this was not a vocation looked upon with favor by any except his mother. While his father was away on a trip to South America, at age 18 George went to live with and work for a Mr. Johnson, a piano teacher in Boston. For his pay, young George received three dollars a week, board and room, and piano lessons. In a few weeks playing for prayer meetings and teaching some of the beginning pupils. He met Lowell Mason and sang bass in his Bowdoin Street Choir. By 1841 Root was a teacher of music teachers, assisting Mason in his work. Moving to New York in 1844, he taught music at Rutgers Female Institute, Abbott’s School for Young Ladies, Union Theological Seminary, and the New York Institute for the Blind, where Fanny Crosby (who was his age) was one of his pupils. He collaborated with her in producing a cantata, “The Flower Queen,” and set some of her poems to music.\n\nIn 1858 he moved to Chicago and devoted himself to writing, publishing, and conducting normals, or summer learning sessions for music teachers, which he, with Mason, originated. With his brother and C. M. Cady, they formed Root and Cady Music Publishers, which very successfully marketed his popular songs about the Civil War, including “Tramp, Tramp, Tramp, the Boys Are Marching,” and some 75 collections of hymns, songs, and arrangements. In the destruction caused by the Chicago fire, their firm lost about $250,000! Most of the printing plates were saved, and they sold out to the John Church Company. Root continued with his writing and conventions until his death on August 6, 1895, at his summer home at Bailey Island, Maine.\n\nRoot also wrote the music for: SDAH 218, “When He Cometh“; SDAH 366, “O Where Are the Reapers?“; and SDAH 692 QUAM DILECTA, for “The Lord Is In His Holy Temple.”",

    "historicalContext": "This is a metrical version of Psalm 96, first entitled “The Lord of the Gentiles.” Isaac Watts (1674–1748; see Biographies) printed it in his Psalms of David Imitated in the Language of the New Testament, 1719. Originally it was in 8.8.8.8.D. meter, but has been altered through the years, the third and sixth lines being shortened to make the meter 8.8.6.6.D. For example, “To sing and bless His holy name” has become “And bless His holy name.” The omitted second stanza, which shows Watts’s extreme chauvinism, is:\n\nThe heathens know Thy glory, Lord;\nThe wondering nations read Thy Word,\nIn Britain is Jehovah known:\nOur worship shall no more be paid\nTo gods which mortal hands have made;\nOur Maker is our God alone.\n\nOLD 113TH gets its name from the practice of giving a tune the same number as the psalm for which it was composed or for which it had become the most accepted. This custom dated back to William Kethe’s Genevan Psalter, 1561 (to be distinguished from Bourgeois’ Genevan Psalter, 1551). OLD 113TH is one of the seven melodies thought to have been contributed by Greiter to the book Strassburger Kirchenamt, 1525. John Calvin took it from a German psalter of 1526 and set it to Psalm 86 in his 1562 Psalter. It was also used for Psalm 36. The original tune was longer, irregular, and syncopated. Many editors, over a long period of time, were involved in changing it to its shorter, more regular form. J. S. Bach wrote a fine chorale setting of the tune and also composed an organ chorale prelude based upon it. Creative leaders will find possibilities for antiphonal singing of this hymn.\n\nMatthäus Greiter was born c. 1500 at Aichach, Bavaria. He studied to be a singer and Roman Catholic monk at Strasbourg, but in 1524 he became a Lutheran minister there. John Calvin came to Strasbourg and preached from 1538 to 1541; he saw the success Greiter enjoyed in achieving fine congregational singing, so made him music editor of Calvin’s first Psalter, Strasbourg, 1539. Greiter served two churches and directed a choir-school before returning to the Roman Catholic Church. He died on December 20, 1550 (some say 1552).\n\nThe arrangement of OLD 113TH that SDAH uses is by Vicar Earl Coates (1921–; see SDAH 71), who arranged, a Methodist composer, editor, and writer. He was a member of the subcommittee on hymn tunes for the 1964 revision of the Methodist Hymnal.",

    "historicalContext": "From more than 1,000 manuscripts submitted in the Hymn Society of America’s 1929 search for new missionary hymns, this one took first place. It was first sung at the Riverdale Presbyterian Church, New York, in 1930, and since then has found favor with the editors of many hymnals. The first part of each stanza extols the majesty and power of God, and the last of each is a prayer for clear vision to see the mission of the church in the world. This is an example of a number of hymns that could be placed under more than one topic.\n\nThe first half of stanza 2 and the last half of stanza 5 have been omitted.\n\nHenry Hallam Tweedy was born August 5, 1868, at Binghamton, New York, and educated at Andover Academy and Yale University. After graduate study at Union Theological Seminary, New York, and Berlin University, he was ordained a Congregational minister and served churches in Utica, New York, and Bridgeport, Connecticut. For about 30 years, until 1937, he was professor of practical theology at Yale Divinity School, where he emphasized the importance of hymnology in the work of the minister. His study of the theology and poetry of hymns led him to try his hand at the art, but this is the only one of his hymns that has been used extensively. He wrote The Minister and His Hymnal and compiled a hymnal entitled Christian Worship and Praise in 1939. He died April 11, 1953, at Brattleboro, Vermont.\n\nRalph Vaughan Williams (1872–1958), noted for his research in and use of folk hymns, found FOREST GREEN in a small village of that name only five miles from Kingsfold (see SDAH 144), in Surrey, England. The original song was The Ploughboy’s Dream. He used it with O Little Town of Bethlehem (which at SDAH 135 is suggested as an alternate tune for that text) in English Hymnal, 1906, for which he was musical editor.\n\nSDAH uses the tune again at SDAH 168, And Have the Bright Immensities.",

    "historicalContext": "The tune of this hymn in unusual meter was in extensive use in southern Germany before 1700. It appeared as a hymn tune in 1623, set to an Easter hymn, Lasst uns Erfreuen Herzlich Sehr (Let Us Most Heartily Rejoice). It was revived when set to these words by John Athelstan Laurie Riley and published in the English Hymnal, 1906, of which Riley was one of the editors. Of the original four stanzas, the third was omitted by SDAH because of unscriptural references to the state of the dead.\n\nRiley was born in Paddington, London, on August 10, 1858. He was educated at Eton and Oxford, gaining his B.A. in 1881, and the M.A. two years later. He traveled extensively in the Middle East and published several pamphlets and articles on the Eastern Christian church. He was a great supporter of the Anglo-Catholic movement. He died on November 17, 1945, in the township of Trinity, Jersey, in the Channel Islands. (He had purchased the Manor of Trinity and thus had become virtually the owner of the Isle of Jersey and Seigneur [Lord] of La Trinité.) The opposition to the English Hymnal because of its High Church leanings was softened to a great extent by Riley’s lectures on the book, illustrated by a group of singers.\n\nLASST UNS ERFREUEN (see SDAH 2) is also used for SDAH 228. It was arranged in a consistent 3/2 time by Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872–1958).",

    "historicalContext": "Maltbie Davenport Babcock was a gifted and powerful Presbyterian preacher, an athlete, and a great lover of nature. During his first pastorate at Lockport, New York, in the early 1880s, he used to take early-morning walks, saying, “I’m going out to be in my Father’s world.” He wrote a 16-stanza poem, each first line beginning “This is my Father’s world,” first published after his death, in Thoughts for Everyday Living, 1901.\n\nBabcock was born in Syracuse, New York, on August 3, 1858. He graduated from the university there in 1875 and proceeded to the Auburn Theological Seminary to train for the Presbyterian ministry. He was ordained, and during his first appointment at Lockport wrote this hymn. He was transferred to Baltimore in 1887 and served in the Brown Memorial Church for 14 years. His next appointment was to the Brick Presbyterian Church in New York City, where he ministered for only a year and a half. He died in Naples, Italy, on May 18, 1901, while on a visit to the Holy Land.\n\nTERRA BEATA (Blessed Land) was composed in 1915 by Franklin Lawrence Sheppard and appears in Alleluia, the Presbyterian Sunday school hymnal of 1915, which Sheppard edited. It is given there as a “traditional English melody”because he had memories of learning it from his mother when he was a child. It could be an English folk tune ROSPER, which appears in the English Hymnal of 1909 and to which it bears a resemblance in six of its eight lines. Sheppard was born on August 7, 1852, in Philadelphia and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1872. He took charge of his father’s foundry, which made stoves and heaters in Baltimore, and joined the Presbyterian church in that city. He studied music, was music director in his own church, and for a time was organist at the Zion Protestant Episcopal Church. He served on the committee that produced the Presbyterian Hymnal, 1911. He died at Germantown, Pennsylvania, February 15, 1930.",

    "historicalContext": "Cecil Humphreys was very much concerned when she overheard one of her godsons complaining about not being able to understand the catechism, so she decided to simplify the difficulty by writing hymns for children based on the different articles of the Apostles’ Creed. This hymn amplifies and simplifies the first of the 12 clauses, “I believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth”; it appeared in her Hymns for Little Children, 1848. There were seven stanzas, the seventh being the same as the first and not really intended to be used as a refrain. The two omitted are:\n\n3. The rich man in his castle,\nThe poor man at his gate;\nGod made them, high or lowly,\nAnd ordered their estate.\n\n6. The tall trees in the greenwood,\nThe meadows where we play,\nThe rushes by the water,\nWe gather every day.\n\nCecil Frances Humphreys was born in 1818 at Redcross, County Wicklow, Ireland, and showed poetic talent. In 1846 she wrote a volume of devotional poems, and in 1848 Hymns for Little Children. In 1850 she married William Alexander, then a curate in Londonderry, who in 1867 became bishop of Derry and Raphoe, and in 1896, archbishop of Armagh and primate of all Ireland. She wrote about 200 hymns and 200 poems, most of them for children, as well as other books. She died in Londonderry on October 12, 1895. Her other hymns in SDAH are: SDAH 149 Once in Royal David’s City; SDAH 164 There Is a Green Hill Far Away; SDAH 285 Jesus Calls Us\n\nROYAL OAK was adapted in 1915 from an English traditional melody by Martin Edward Fallas Shaw (1875–1958; see Biographies). It was a song in honor of the restoration of Charles II to the throne, May 29, 1660, and titled appropriately, “The Twenty-ninth of May.” The name of the hymn tune recalls the fact that Charles had hidden in an oak tree in Boscobel, Shropshire, in 1651,after his defeat at the battle of Worcester.",

    "historicalContext": "This hymn by Isaac Watts (1674–1748; see Biographies) appears in his Hymns and Spiritual Songs, 1707, under the title “Christ Crucified, the Wisdom and Power of God.” Originally, there were six stanzas. Watts’s title indicates that this hymn should be included in the SDAH section on Christ’s sufferings and death, for the first stanza is introductory only, speaking of one aspect of God’s power and glory. But as stanza 2 states, God’s brightest glory was shown in His sacrifice for humanity. The words were inspired by the apostle Paul: “But we preach Christ crucified … Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God” (1 Cor. 1:23, 24).\n\nNot willing for “God the Savior” to love and die, most hymnal editors changed it to “Christ the Savior.” There are a number of minor alterations in the four stanzas in SDAH, two of them to change the sexually exclusive words “her” and “man” to “its” and “us.” The first word of the fourth stanza has been changed from “I” to the collective “we.” Some feel this atonement hymn ranks right up there next to “When I Survey the Wondrous Cross” as one of Watts’s finest works. Strangely, it appears in very few hymnals. The Dictionary of American Hymnology lists it in a Baptist book, Hymns and Spiritual Songs, 1766, by Samuel Hall, Newport, Rhode Island. It was included in Congregational Praise, 1951, and Lutheran Book of Worship, 1978.\n\nNot much is known of Georg Joseph, composer of the tune ANGELUS. He was a musician employed in the seventeenth century by the prince-bishop of Breslau, Germany. Collaborating with Lutheran poet and physician Johann Scheffler (1624–1677), he published five books of hymns from 1657 to 1668. The volume containing this tune (and 184 more of his) was Heilige Seelenlust (Holy Desire for Souls), 1657. The original tune was a soprano solo styled after Italian secular music. Undergoing some changes from the original, the SDAH form of the tune is from Cantica Spiritualia, Munich, 1847, with further rhythmic changes from the version printed in the 1875 revised edition of Hymns Ancient and Modern. Joseph named this tune ANGELUS to commemorate his collaborator, Scheffler, who, though brought up a Lutheran, converted to the Roman Catholic faith in 1653 and took the name Angelus Silesius when he became a priest.",

    "yearWritten": 1928,
    "historicalContext": "This delightful carol for spring first appeared in Piae Cantiones (Sacred Songs), printed by Theodoric Petri in Nyland, Finland, 1582. Even though the texts of this collection were in Latin, it was a Protestant publication, with this full title: Sacred Songs of Church and Cloister of the clergy of past ages, in common use in the Renowned Realm of Sweden; newly and accurately revised and corrected by the labour of the same most reverend and honorable member of the Church of God, and of the School of Åbo in Finland, Theodoric Petri of Nyland, now committed to print, 1582.\n\nAround 1850, G. J. R. Gordon, Her Majesty’s envoy and minister at Stockholm, brought back a copy to England and gave it to the translator, John M. Neale, who wrote words for several of the carols. For this tune he wrote “Good King Wenceslas.” While working on the Oxford Book of Carols, 1928, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Percy Dearmer, and Martin Shawelected to use their own free translation of the spring carol from Piae Cantiones, beginning “Tempus adest floridum”(The time of flowers is here). This is the version SDAH uses, omitting stanzas 4 and 5.\n\nThe Methodist Hymnal, 1964, is one of the very few present-day books to use this spring carol. SDAH uses the same arrangement by Ernest MacMillan, considered Canada’s most noted musician. Born August 18, 1893, in Mimico, Ontario, into the home of a Presbyterian minister and hymn book editor, Ernest grew up in an atmosphere of church music. At age 10, he played the organ at Massey Hall, Toronto, and at 13 won the Bronze Medal for harmony at University of Edinburgh, Scotland. At age 18, he won the highest mark of all candidates for the Fellow of the Royal College of Organists and graduated B. Mus. from Oxford University.\n\nWhile attending the Bayreuth Wagner Festival in 1914, MacMillan was interned and spent World War I as a prisoner. Making the most of his time, he composed Ode for Chorus and Orchestra, which won for him the D. Mus. from Oxford in 1918. Back in Canada, he had a most distinguished career as a teacher, administrator, church musician, organ recitalist, and conductor. He was conductor of the Toronto Symphony, 1931–1956, and of the Toronto Mendelssohn Choir, 1942–1957. King George VI knighted him in 1935 for his services to the cause of music in Canada, the first person in the Commonwealth outside of the United Kingdom to receive such an honor. He was a humble man, but one who always insisted on the highest standards of excellence. He died in Toronto on May 6, 1973.",

    "yearWritten": 1712,
    "historicalContext": "In The Spectator of August 23, 1712, Joseph Addison contributed “An Essay on the Proper Means of Strengthening and Confirming Faith in the Mind of Man,” in which he suggested that faith could best be strengthened by retiring from the hustle and bustle of life and quietly meditating on the wonderful works of God. He then referred to the first verse of the nineteenth psalm, saying that David had some “very beautiful strokes of poetry to this purpose in that exalted strain.” Then follow these three stanzas, which paraphrase the first four verses of the psalm.\n\nJoseph Addison was born on May 1, 1672, at Milston, Wiltshire, England, the son of an Anglican clergyman. He graduated from Magdalen College, Oxford, with a B.A. in 1691, and an M.A. in 1693. He trained to follow his father’s profession but turned instead to literature and politics. He held important positions in government, being a commissioner of appeals in 1704, under-secretary of state 1706, and a member of Parliament from 1708 until his death. From 1709 to 1711, he was secretary to the lord lieutenant of Ireland. In 1714, he was appointed chief secretary to Ireland and in 1716, lord commissioner of trade.\n\nAddison is best known, however, for his literary contributions. His essays appeared in The Tatler from 1709, and in 1711, he collaborated with his friend Sir Richard Steele to bring out The Spectator, which contained many of Addison’s essays and also many original hymns. Both Isaac Watts and John Wesley regarded highly his literary style and content. He resigned his political office in 1718 because of failing health. He died at Holland House, Kensington, London, on June 17, 1719, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.\n\nCREATION is an arrangement from the oratorio of this name, composed in 1798 by Franz Joseph Haydn. It is an adaptation of the first part of “The Heavens Are Telling.”\n\nHaydn was born at Rohrau, 25 miles southeast of Vienna, Austria, on March 31, 1732, and was educated at the Roman Catholic choir school of St. Stefan’s Cathedral in Vienna for nearly 10 years. In 1749, he was expelled and was forced to support himself by playing in street bands, teaching, and occasionally writing music. He composed his first mass in 1750 and composed a series of string quartets published in 1755. In 1761, he was appointed director of music at the house of Prince Paul Anton Esterházy, remaining there until 1791, when the grandson of his patron dismissed most of the musicians of the household. Haydn went to England for two years, and the University of Oxford awarded him the D. Mus. degree. He returned to Vienna in 1792, went back to England in 1794, and finally to Vienna in 1795, where he stayed until his death on May 31, 1809.\n\nHe composed more than 100 symphonies, 80 string quartets, 100 works for chamber music, 60 sonatas for piano, 16 masses, 22 operas, and 4 oratorios. He always prefaced his scores with the words “In nomine Domini” (in the name of the Lord) and concluded them with “Laus Deo” (praise go to God). Haydn also composed the tune for SDAH 423, AUSTRIA.\n\nThe first arrangement of this melody for the words is found in Sacred Melodies, 1812, by William Gardiner (1770–1853; see SDAH 177).",

    "historicalContext": "Before his death, Albert Bayly (1901–1984; see Biographies) was recognized as the dean of contemporary British hymn writers. A talk given on the British Broadcasting Company’s Third Program by J. Isaacs on January 17, 1949, entitled “Poetry and Science,” suggested the words of this hymn to Bayly. It first appeared in seven stanzas in his booklet of hymns and poems, Rejoice, O People, in 1950.\n\nBayly shows his interest in both religion and science, for with mention of such scientific terms as curved space, energy, galaxy, and atom, he also includes several scriptural allusions: “For he spake, and it was done” (Ps. 33:9); “The mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed” (Eph. 1:9); “So God created man in his own image” (Gen. 1:27); “Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free” (John 8:32) Changes have been made from the original “Thy” and “Thine” to “You” and “Yours”, and in the first stanza from “The fount of energy” to “All nature’s energy.”\n\nFrom his home in Cambridge, England, Derek Williams writes that SAN ROCCO was composed in 1968 to be sung to “Give Me the Wings of Faith,” by Isaac Watts. This was a contribution to a service sung that summer in Lichfield Cathedral by the choir of Selwyn College; the service commemorated the centenary of George Augustus Selwyn’s appointment as bishop of Lichfield. Bayly’s “Lord of the Boundless Curves of Space” was first associated with this tune in the United Reformed Church hymnal, New Church Praise, 1975.\n\nDerek Williams was born September 16, 1945, in Sheffield, Yorkshire, England, and educated at King Edward VII School. At Selwyn College, Cambridge, 1964 to 1968, he earned the M.A. and B.Mus. degrees. Since 1970 he has been working as head of the Music Department at the Cambridge University Library.",

My husband was spending several weeks at the school, making a songbook for the president of the school. ‘God Will Take Care of You’ was written one Sunday afternoon while my husband went to a preaching appointment. When he returned, I gave the words to him. He immediately sat down to his little Bilhorn organ [a small portable instrument] and wrote the music. That evening he and two of the teachers sang the completed song. It was then printed in the songbook he was compiling for the school” (Songs of Redemption and Praise, 1905).\n\nCivilla Durfee Martin was born August 21, 1866, at Jordan, Nova Scotia. A schoolteacher and musician, she married Walter Stillman Martin and assisted him in evangelistic campaigns. She died in Atlanta, Georgia, on March 9, 1948.\n\nStillman Martin was born in 1862 at Rowley, Massachusetts, and attended Harvard University. Ordained a Baptist minister, he later changed to work for the Christian Church, or Disciples of Christ. In 1916, he became a professor of Bible study at the Atlantic Christian College in North Carolina. His final home was Atlanta, from which he traveled widely, holding Bible conferences and evangelistic meetings. He died December 16, 1935.\n\nCollaborating with his wife, Civilla, he wrote a number of gospel songs used in his work.",

    "historicalContext": "In 1923 Thomas Crisholm sent this hymn to his coworker, William M. Runyan, who set it to music. In 1954 Runyan wrote to William J. Reynolds (see SDAH 642): “I wrote harmonies to some 20 or 25 of [Crisholm’s] poems. This particular poem held such an appeal that I prayed most earnestly that my tune might carry over its message in a worthy way, and the subsequent history of its use indicates that God answered prayer. It was written in Baldwin, Kansas, in 1923.” Runyan published it first in his Songs of Salvation, and many hymnbook editors have made a place for it since. It used at Moody Bible Institute by the president, Dr. Houghton, and over the years became the unofficial theme song for that school. It was sung by a large audience at Dr Houghton’s funeral. The composer named the tune FAITHFULNESS for inclusion in the Baptist Hymnal, 1956.\n\nThomas Obediah Crisholm was born near Franklin, Kentucky, July 29, 1866. After only an eighth-grade education in a small country school, he became the teacher himself at age 16! At 21 he was associate director of the hometown paper, the Franklin Favorite. After his conversion in a revival meeting conducted by H.C. Morrison, Chrisholm accepted the preacher’s invitation to move to Louisville and become office editor and business manager of his paper, the Pentecostal Herald. He was ordained a Methodist minister in 1903, but because of ill health, he was able to serve as pastor for only one year. After five years on a farm near Winona Lake, Indiana, he became a life insurance agent there, and continued that work in Vineland New Jersey, until retirement in 1953.\n\nOf the more than 1,200 poems he wrote, some 800 were published and a number set to music by a dozen of the best-known gospel song composers of that time. Franny Crosby took a great interest in his early writing and di much encourage him. He said of his work, “I have sought to be true to the Word, and to avoid flippant and catchy titles and treatment. I have greatly desired that each hymn or poem might have some definite message of the hearts for whom it was written.” Another lyric by Crisholm that has had wide usage is “Living for Jesus a life that is true.” He died at Ocean Grove, New Jersey, February 29, 2960.\n\nWilliam Marion Runyan was born January 21, 2870, at Marion, New York, the son of a Methodist minister. As a youth he showed musical talent, playing the organ for church at age 12. Ordained a Methodist minister at age 21, he served several pastorates in Kansas for 12 years before his appointment as evangelist for the Central Kansas Methodist Conference in 1903. After 20 years in this work, he was forced by increasing deafness to take up other duties, and became associated with John Brown University, Sulphur Springs, Arkansas. HE pastored the Federated Church and edited the Christian Worker Magazine, 1923-1925. Until retirement in 1948, he did some work for Moody Bible Institute and served as an editor for Hope Publishing Company. Wheaton College in Illinois conferred on him the honorary Litt.D. in 1948. Death came at Pittsburgh, Kansas, on July 29, 1957.",

    "historicalContext": "This beautiful, tender hymn about the heavenly Father’s loving concern for His children was written by Carolina Vilhelmina Sandell Berg, known as the “Franny Crosby of Sweden.” Born October 3, 1832, to a Lutheran pastor’s family in Fröderyd, Småland, south Sweden, she was stricken with paralysis at age 12 and declared incurable by the doctors, but later she regained her health. When she was 26, her father drowned as a result of boating accident, while she watched helplessly. Her first 14 hymns were published that same year. Two years later her mother died. It is a tribute to her faith that many of her hymns express an unquestioning confidence in God and His love in spite of all the sorrow she endured. For a time she did editorial work for the Evangelical National Foundation, and after marriage in 1867 she assisted her husband, C.O. Berg, a wealthy Stockholm businessman, with his literary work.\n\nLina, as she was known, was greatly influenced by the preaching and teaching of Carl Rosenius, prominent lay leader of the Pietist movement in Sweden, and her hymns became a powerful in the spread of that evangelical fervor. She died July 26, 1903.\n\nThis hymn was written while she was still in her teens, and had one more stanza:\n\nLo, their very hairs He numbers,\nAnd no daily care encumbers\nThem that share His very blessing,\nAnd His help in woes distressing.\n\nFor another of her ultimate total of about 650 hymns, see SDAH 532, “Day by Day.”\n\nThis English version was translated by Ernst Olson, well known for his poetic ability in both languages. Born March 16, 1870, in Sweden, his parents moved to Wahoo, Nebraska, when he was 5, and then later to Texas. In 1981 he graduated from the Lutheran Augustana College, Illinois, and spent his life in editorial work for Swedish publications, a Chicago publishing firm, and the Augustana Book Concern. He was a member of the committee for the 1958 Lutheran Service Book and Hymnal, furnishing a number of translations of Swedish hymns into English. He retired in 1949 and died October 6, 1958.\n\nThe tune TRYGGARE KAN INGEN VARA takes its name from the first words of the Swedish original, literally, “No one can be safer.” First printed in Song Book for Sunday Schools, Stockholm, 1871, in most books it is called a Swedish folk song. However, the director of the Royal School of Music in Stockholm, Gerald Göransson, believed it might have been one of the songs that made its way over from England during the Pietistic revival of the early nineteenth century. Another Swedish authority traces it to a Swedish folk melody originating in Germany, as it has many similarities to songs of the German soldiery of the early 1800s. IT was first used in America in the Augustana Lutheran Synod’s Hemlandssanger, 1890.\n\nFor a unison version of this tune arranged by Melvin West (1939-), see SDAH 153.",

    "historicalContext": "This is a metrical version (see SDAH 16) of Psalm 121. There are eight verses in the psalm, and each of the hymn’s stanzas covers two verses. It has been favorite in Canada, and during World War II was very popular with the Canadian soldiers.\n\nJohn Douglas Sutherland Campbell, ninth duke of Argyll, was born August 6, 1845, in Westminster, London. Educated at Eton, St. Andrew’s and Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1868 he became the liberal member of Parliament representing Argyll, at age 23. After marrying Princess Louise, daughter of Queen Victoria, he served three years as private secretary to his father, who was secretary of state for India. From 1878 to 1883 he was governor-general of Canada. Returning to England, he again went to Parliament, representing the Unionists in Manchester, 1895 to 1900. He died of double pneumonia while on vacation on the Isle of Wight, May 2, 1914. When he published his Book of Psalms (metrical versions of all the psalms) in 1877, he had the title Marquis of Lorne, having succeeded to the dukedom in 1900.\n\nJames Bingham (1945-; see SDAH 54) was a member of the SDAH Committee, representing the Canadian and Australian viewpoints, and served on the tuned subcommittee., He gives this insight on how the tune was written: “The SDAH Committee was having trouble finding the music to fit this text. ALBERTA, the most common tune for these words, did not provide what was wanted. Since a part of our working philosophy was that the hymnal should be attractive to young worshippers, and because there was a shortage if acceptable hymn tunes that had a youthful contemporary sound, I decided to try to take this magnificent text and wed it to a youthful sound. YOU YANGS is the result. The name is taken from a range of mountains that dominate the landscape of Geelong, Victoria, Australia, my hometown. The mountains look like a series of pyramids rising from a flat plain, and are extinct volcanoes. My father had a business by the ocean, and as a child I used to look across the water and watch the shipping against the backdrop of these volcanic hills. Thus the connection to the text.”\n\nBingham is also the composer of the SDAH 54, PHOS HILARON; SDAH 81, JANELLE; AND SDAH 148, INFINITE LOVE.",

    "yearWritten": 1719,
    "historicalContext": "This paraphrase of the first part of Psalm 90, which is attributed to Moses, appears in Watt’s Psalms of David, 1719, in nine stanzas. Isaac Watts (1674-1748; see Biographies) titles it “Man Frail and God Eternal.” He wrote it at a time when the Dissenters, that is, those who did not conform to the established Church of England, were in danger of severe persecution and of having their schools and academies closed. However, the death of Queen Anne on the very day that the Schism Bill of 1714 was due to go into effect and the coming to the throne of George I, brought them relief.\n\nJohn Wesley changed Watt’s opening word “Our” to “O,” and there have been two other slight changes from the original. The second line of the second stanza was “Thy saints have dwelt secure,” and the third line of the last stanza was “Be Thou our guard while troubles last.”\n\nWatts was a master of simplicity; in SDAH’s five stanzas there is a total of 140 syllables, 91 of which are one-syllable words. The last stanza has 23 monosyllabic words, one of two syllables, and one of three. Since the inclusion of this text and tune in the 1961 Hymns Ancient and Modern, it has served the British Commonwealth almost as a second national anthem.\n\nST. ANNE was composed by William Croft and commemorates the 12 years when he was organist at St. Anne’s Church in Soho, London. Handel used in the tune in his anthem “O Praise the Lord,” and J.S. Bach constructed his “Fugue in E-flat,” usually called “St. Anne’s Fugue” around the tune. Ralph Vaughan Williams utilized it also in his “Lord, Thou Hast Been Our Refuge,” 1921.\n\nWilliam Croft was born at Nether Ettington in Warwickshire, near Stratford-upon-Avon, on 1678. HE became a chorister at the Chapel Royal, and then organist at St. Anne’s, Soho, in London from 1700 to 1712. He was also joint organist with Jeremiah Clarke (see SDAH 19) at the Chapel Royal from 1704, and in 1708 organist at Westminster Abbey. The University of Oxford granted him the degree of D.Mus. in 1713. At first, Croft wrote songs and odes for the theater, but later composed music for harpsichord and violin, and hymn tunes for the church. He wrote 30 anthems and psalm tunes. He died at Bath, Somerset, on August 14, 1727. Croft also composed SDAH 256, HANOVER.",

    "historicalContext": "This is a paraphrase of Psalm 23 by Isaac Watts (1674-1748; see Biographies). It was first published in his The Psalms of David, Imitated in the Language of the New Testament, and Applied to the Christian State and Worship, 1719. He made three paraphrases of this psalm and headed all of them “God Our Shepherd.” The first was in eight stanzas of long meter, this one in six stanzas of common meter, and the third in six stanzas of short meter. The SDAH hymn simply combines each pair of stanzas, making the hymn one of three stanzas of eight lines each, the original wording being followed exactly.\n\nRESIGNATION is one of those early American tunes that appeared in dozens of shaped-note, oblong books, mostly in the South (see comments on BEACH SPRING, SDAH 363). It is in the pentatonic scale, that is, it can be played entirely by using only the black notes on the piano. This means that there are no half-step intervals in the melody, only whole steps. William Walker included it in the 1854 edition of his Southern Harmony, 1835, but no composer is given. The earliest combination of this text and tune seems to have been in John W. Steffy’s The Valley Ilarmonist, Winchester, Virginia, 1836. Melvin harmonic West’s progressions (1930-, that sec have Biographies) bccomc dear adaptation to all who preserves have sungthe or heard the choral anthem on this text and tune by the eminent American composer Virgil Thompson.\n\nBorn November 25, 1896, in Kansas City, Missouri, Thompson was educated in public schools and enlisted in the Army, becoming a second lieutenant in the U.S. Military Aviation Corps during World War L After the war he attended Harvard University, graduating in 1922. While there he was awarded the Payne Fellowship, which sent him to Paris in 1921 to study with Nadia Boulanger. For a time he was assistant instructor of music at Harvard, and assistant to Archibald T. Davison, famed conductor of the Harvard Glee Club. In 1922 he was appointed organist-choirmaster at King’s Chapel, Boston, where he also began to write essays and criticisms of the musical scene. Further study at Julliard School of Music, New York, and at Ecole Normale de Musique, Paris, helped to mature his style as a composer of music that is regarded as almost classic in American musical theater. In 1940 he became music critic for the New York Herald Tribune, where his witty, succinct, and penetrating reviews of musical events secured for him a great reputation. His experience as a church musician is reflected in the hymnlike melodies that surface in many of his works. Thomson is known for two operas, Four Saints in Three Acts and The Mother of Us All; a ballet, Filling Station; and chamber, choral, orchestral, band, organ, and vocal works.\n\nSouthern Harmony was a collection of hymns made by William Walker (1809-1875), born in South Carolina, the son of a Welsh immigrant. He became a singing teacher and collected folk hymns and tunes from the southern Appalachian region, many of which were of British origin. He was assisted in his collection by his brother-in-law, Benjamin Franklin White (1800-1879), but Walker’s name was the only one on the title page. White subsequently published his own book, The Sacred Harp, in 1844, which in part duplicated much of the material in Southern Harmony. These two books were the most successful of all the tune books published in this era. Southern Harmony also had SDAH 162, WONDROUS LOVE, and SDAH 620, PROMISED LAND.",

    "historicalContext": "This praise hymn was written especially for use on New Year’s Day. It was first published by Charles Wesley (1707-1788; see Biographies), with no author’s name attached, in a little penny tract of seven poems titled Hymns for New Year’s Day, 1750. The Wesleys printed their hymns anonymously because they knew there would be prejudice and some would turn away if their names were on it. Since then it has been included in every Methodist hymnal except the 1882 edition. Minor alterations have been made. The original had three eight-line stanzas. At the turning of the year, when there is a sense of new beginnings, the hymn recalls the Lord’s promise to King Solomon: “I will lengthen thy days” (1 Kings 3:14).\n\nThe tune LOBT GOTT, IHR CHRISTEN was written by Nikolaus Herman in 1554 and included in his Ein Christlicher Abendreihen (A Christian Service for Evenings), Leipzig, matched with a children’s hymn about the life of John the Baptist. In 1560 he put it in his Die Sonntags Evangelia iiber das ganze Jahr (The Gospel for Sundays Throughout the Whole Year) to “Lobt Gott, Ihr Christen alle gleich” (Praise God All Together, Ye Christians), hence the tune name. Much of our enjoyment of this tune comes from the rising scale passage in the final score, and the refrain-like ending.\n\nHerman was born c. 1490 in Altdorf, near Nuremburg, Germany. For the greater part of his life he was organist-choirmaster at St. Joachimstal in Bohemia. Often a good sermon by his pastor would inspire a new hymn on the same subject, which Herman wrote mainly for the children of the school. It is believed that the fine chorales he published with these poems were of his own composition. After he died, on May 3, 1561, his pastor recorded this on the church register: “Nikolaus Herman, a good musician who wrote many fine chorales and German songs, rests in the Lord.”\n\nThe Lutheran Hymnal, Concordia, 1941, uses eight of his hymns, the most found in any recent collection. This tune appears in many hymnals, some with a slightly different form of the melody.",

    "historicalContext": "This paraphrase by Isaac Watts (1674-1748; see Biographies), one of three he made of Psalm 136, appears in his Psalms of David, 171% and is listed as “Abridged.” There is also a note: “1 have maintained the chorus ‘For His mercy endureth forever’ in a double form, to be used alternately, i.e., In every other stanza.” This is made clear by the repetition in the odd stanzas of the last two lines and in the even stanzas of the third line only. It is interesting to compare another paraphrase of this same psalm by John Milton, SDAH 1 12, “Let Us With a Gladsome Mind. “\n\nThe tune name DUNEDIN is from the old name for Edinburgh. The tune was first composed to accompany a text by O. B. Frothingham (1822-1895), “Thou Lord of Hosts, Whose Guiding Hand.” The setting was intended for unison singing at the King Edward Technical College of Dunedin, New Zealand, and was used in this way for many years, beginning in 1935.\n\nVernon Griffiths was born June 22, 1894, in West Kirby, Cheshire, England. After serving in World War I, he graduated from Cambridge in music and arts. He went to New Zealand in 1927 to lecture in music at the Christchurch Teachers College. In 1933 he became music master at the King Edward Technical College in Dunedin. Here he pioneered school music techniques that won him and the school an international reputation for practical musicmaking and the involvement of the whole school as a part-singing choir. In 1942 he was appointed professor of music and department head at the University of Canterbury. Curriculum reform and the growth of the town-gown relationship through community choirs, orchestras, and bands were manifestations of his tenure. He negated the ivory tower concept of university education. He was awarded the Order of the British Empire and an honorary D. Mus. degree from the University of Canterbury. He died in Christchurch, New Zealand, in November 1985.",

    "historicalContext": "This hymn was written no later than August 1773, for it is quoted in a letter by John Newton (see Biographies), and then published in 1774 in Twenty-six Letters on Religious Subjects by Omicron, a pseudonym for Newton. It appeared in other publications soon after, and then in the Olney Hymns, 1779, all of which were written either by Newton or William Cowper. The fact that this hymn of six stanzas, No. XV in Book Ill, is here signed “C” indicates that Cowper was the author, and furthermore that it was not written after an attempted suicide even though Cowper did attempt to take his own life more than once. The title of the hymn is “Light Shining Out of Darkness”; a footnote to the last stanza reads: “John 13: 7, ‘Thou shalt know hereafter.”\n\nWilliam Cowper was born at Berkhampstead, near Watford, Hertford_ shire, England, on November 26, 1731, He pronounced his name Cooper, as did his forebears (his great-grandfather’s great-grandfather was lord mayor of London in the mid-sixteenth century). When Cowper was only 6 years old, his mother died; this upset his highly strung and sensitive nature, all the more so as he was sent to a boarding school at Markyate, where he was mercilessly bullied. For his secondary education he went to Westminster School; then he worked in a solicitor’s office and trained for the legal profession, although he never practiced. His father died in 1756; whereupon his friends arranged for him to become a clerk in the House of Lords, Parliament’s upper house, but he had a complete nervous breakdown when he realized that he had to appear in person for an oral examination for this post. His mental state was not improved by his fruitless love for his cousin Theodora, whose father forbade the match. He spent the next 18 months in a mental institution; during his periods of mental instability he attempted suicide by poison, by hanging himself, by the knife, and later by drowning. However, he found relief and comfort in the home of the Reverend and Mrs. Morley Unwin at Huntingdon in 1765. Unfortunately, Unwin died two years later after an accident, but Mrs. Unwin cared for Cowper like a mother. Having already met and been befriended by John Newton, Cowper, with Mrs. Unwin, moved to Olney in Buckinghamshire, where Newton was the Anglican curate. Cowper planned marriage with Mrs. Unwin, but unfortunately he suffered a bout of very severe depression, and the marriage became postponed permanently.\n\nCowper recovered and collaborated with Newton, whom he assisted in his ministry; 348 Olney hymns (68 by Cowper) were composed and used in their revival meetings in the town. After Newton moved to London in 1780 and under the influence and encouragement of another friend, Lady Austen, Cowper produced some of his best literary work. Having already published his Poems in 1782, in 1783 he wrote the “Journey of John Gilpin,” and in 1785, his long poem The Task, which established him as a leading poet. He also wrote Anti-Thelyphthora in 1781, which was a reply to his cousin Martin Madan’s (see SDAH 21 1) book advocating polygamy. Between the years 1785 and 1791 he translated Homer, the Greek poet, into English. He died at East Dereham on April 25, 1860. Cowper also wrote SDAH 336, “There Is a Fountain,” and SDAH 315, “C) for a Closer Walk!”\n\nThe tune DUNDEE is one of 12 old melodies assigned to any psalm of that particular meter. Thus it differed, for example, from OLD H UNDREDTH (SDAH 16), which was specifically limited to Psalm 100. DUNDEE appeared as a melody in The CL Psalmes of David, Edinburgh, 1615, where it was named FRENCH TUNE. It was harmonized in the Scottish Psalter of 1625. In Scotland for almost three centuries it has been associated with Psalm 121. In English psalters, for example, Ravenscroft’s of 1621, it is named DUNDY TUNE. DUNDEE as a name commemorates the Scottish town on the Firth of Tay that strongly upheld Protestant doctrines and became a haven of refuge for persecuted Christians, even as Geneva had been earlier. The melody is notable for its progression from one note to the next, generally in steps of one tone, which makes it easy for congregational singing. The greatest interval is a fifth, from do to so, or vice versa.",

    "yearWritten": 1779,
    "historicalContext": "John Newton (1725-1807) never ceased to thank God for His saving grace in transforming him from a slave captain, and later a slave himself, to a Christian minister. In this hymn, originally of six stanzas appearing in the Olney Hymns, 1779, and title “Faith’s Review and Expectation,” he emphasizes the grace of God that he himself experienced. The hymn is his personal testimony, based on David’s humble remarks recorded in 1 Chronicles 17:16,17: “Who am I, Lord God, and what is mine house…? Thou hast…regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O Lord God.”\n\nThe final stanza often associated with this hymn, beginning “When we’ve been there ten thousand years,” is not Newton’s. Erroneously attributed to a John Rees in some books and in first printings of SDAH, it was anonymous as a final stanza to “Jerusalem, My Happy Home” in Baptist Songster, 1829, compiled by R. Winchell in Connecticut. E.O. Excell seems to be the first to put this stanza with Newton’s hymn in his Coronation Hymns, 1910.\n\nThe tune NEW BRITAIN (or HARMONY GROVE or AMAZING GRACE) is of unknown origin. Its earliest publication in America was in Virginia Harmony, 1831, by James Carrell and David Clayton. After this is was picked up by most of the shaped-note, oblong tune books and became a great favorite at camp meetings and singing conventions. The tune is in the pentatonic scale, leaving out the the fourth and seventh notes. George Pullen Jackson, is his Spiritual Folk Songs of Early America, documents a version he heard sung with florid grace notes in every measure. The popularity of this tune through the highlighted in 1972 when a recording, without the words, was made by the band of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, a British regiment stationed in Germany; 375,000 copies sold in a short time in Britain. Folk singer Judy Collins also made a hit record of this song at about the same time.\n\nThe SDAH arrangement is by Robert J. Batistini, who, at this writing, is president of the Hymn Society of America. For 30 years he has been a church organist / musician; for 20 of those years, he has served at St. Barbara’s Catholic Church in the Chicago suburb of Brookfield, Illinois, where he has developed five choirs, 17 cantors, and a music staff of eight. A Vice President and general editor of GIA Publications of Chicago, he is a member of the North American Academy of Liturgy and was largely responsible for the editing of the Catholic hymnal Worship II, 1975. A conductor, speaker, and clinician throughout North America, he is the author of numerous articles on church music for The Hymn and other magazines.",

    "yearWritten": 1911,
    "historicalContext": "This hymn made its first appearance in D. B. Towner’s Hymns Tried and True, 1911, published by the Moody Bible Institute, Chicago. The first stanza is another way of saying what Paul said in Romans 5:20: “But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.”\n\nJulia Harriette Johnston, born January 21, 1849, into a Presbyterian minister’s family in Salineville, Ohio, moved with her family to Peoria at age 6, where her father pastored the First Presbyterian Church the remainder of his life. She never married, and for more than 40 years she was the leader of the young children’s Sunday school in that church. For 20 years she was president of the Presbyterian Missionary Society of Peoria, which was founded by her mother. A prolific writer of materials for children, she published several books: School of the Master, 1880; Bright Threads, 1897; Indian and Spanish Neighbors, 1905; and Fifty Missionary Heroes, 1913. Some 500 hymn poems came from her own pen, set to music by various composers. She died in Peoria March 6, 1919.\n\nDaniel Brink Towner was born March 5, 1850, in Rome, Pennsylvania, and received his early musical training from his music teacher-father. When he was a teenager, his beautiful bass-baritone voice earned for him the title “Wonderful Boy Bass” as he sang the popular bass solos in concerts and did oratorio work. He studied music with George Root and George Webb and began to write songs even before he studied harmony. From 1 870 to 1885 he served as music director for Methodist churches in New York, Ohio, and Kentucky. He did solo work for evangelist Dwight L. Moody in many of the large cities of America before assuming the presidency of Moody Bible Institute of Chicago. Here he helped to train and influence the work of a large number of noted American gospel singers. In his later years he used his talent as a leader of congregational singing in great evangelistic meetings in England.\n\nTowner wrote the music for more than 2,000 gospel songs published all over the world and had a part in editing 14 song books, three of which were for male voices. He was at Longwood, Missouri, when he died October 3, 1919. Other songs by him in SDAH are No. 508, “Anywhere With Jesus,” and No. 590, “Trust and Obey.”",

    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": 1871,
    "historicalContext": "William Walsham How (1823-1897; see Biographies) wrote a special seasonal hymn entitled “Summer,” which began with the words of the second stanza in SDAH. The original, which appears in Church Hymns, 1871, of which How was one of the original compilers, has eight stanzas of four lines each, now adjusted to four stanzas of eight lines each. The words of the title in SDAH are the first line of How’s third stanza. The poem is based on Ecclesiastes 11:7, “Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun.”\n\nHow, a humble bishop who took a personal interest in his flock, draws a spiritual lesson from nature, using the beneficent light of the summer sun as a symbol of God’s extensive mercy and love. Then he likens the darkness of the night to man’s spiritual blindness, asking God to shine His light on the spiritual darkness that beclouds our pilgrim journey to endless day.\n\nRUTH was composed in 1865 by Samuel Smith (1821-1917), an organist of Windsor, England, and set to these words in 1874. It maintains a consistent rhythm, each of its eight lines beginning with a dotted quarter note followed by an eighth note. Smith was born August 29, 1821, in Eton, Buckinghamshire, England, right across the river from Windsor Castle. A chorister of the Chapel Royal, he sang at both the coronation and the funeral of King William IV (1830 and 1837). He filled organist posts at Hayes, Middlesex, Eaton, and Egham before his final job for 34 years at the parish church of Windsor. He taught music at Beaumont College and followed Elvey (see SDAH 223) as conductor of the Eton and Windsor Choral Society. He died at Windsor, Berkshire, on January 1, 1917.",

    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "John W. Peterson, the writer of the words and music of this song, is probably the world’s most well-known gospel song composer now living—in fact, he has been called “Dean of the Christian Composers.” More than 1,000 hymns and gospel songs have come from his prolific pen, and more than 8 million of his 25 cantatas are in circulation. The youngest child of a Swedish-American family, he was born November l, 1921, on a farm near Lindsborg, Kansas. With father and mother and all seven children gifted in singing and playing musical instruments, the house was full of music! John developed a fine voice, and sang in the Covenant Church choir under brother Rudy’s direction, with sister Mary at the piano. A few years later his brothers became evangelists, with John leading the singing, But he did it with such enthusiasm that, combined with inexperience and overuse, his voice was damaged beyond repair. He says, “If that had not happened, I might never have developed as a writer. With my voice damaged, I turned more and more to writing, and that talent was allowed to emerge and develop.\n\nBy the time he finished high school, writing songs was the big thing in Peterson’s life. He was paid $8 for his first published song, “Yet There Is Room,” published in 1940 by R. E, Winsett of Dayton, Tennessee. In 19 42 he joined the Air Force and became a pilot, flying cargo over the Himalaya Mountains, called the ‘ ‘China Hump.” Coming home with more than 50 songs in his notebook, he attended Moody Bible Institute, Chicago, where he worked on radio station WMBI. ( (It Took a Miracle” was used in 1948 on the national television program Young People’s Church of the Air, hosted by Percy Crawford, who paid John $40 for the song. It was an instant success, and was recorded by many famous artists, making it for several years the number one gospel song in America.\n\nAfter earning a B.Mus. at American Conservatory, Chicago, in 1951, Peterson joined Alfred B. Smith as editor and composer for Singspiration, Inc., of Montrose, Pennsylvania. He served as president of the company in 1963 when it was acquired by Zondervan Publishing House, Grand Rapids, Michigan. In 197 1 he became “executive composer,” and moved to Arizona, where he continues writing, editing, and publishing. Great Hymns of Faith, 1968, was produced under his guiding hand. He has received three honorary doctor’s degrees: from John Brown University, 1967; from Western Conservative Baptist Seminary, Portland, Oregon, 197 1; and from Grand Canyon College, Phoenix, Arizona, 1979. He is president of John W. Peterson Music Company, in which his whole family of three daughters and a son are involved.\n\nIn his autobiography The Miracle Goes On, he tells about the writing of “It Took a Miracle “: “I sat in a classroom at Moody [Bible Institute] one day when the lecturer said something that started me thinking in a concentrated way about the grace and love of God as seen in the work of Calvary, and about the tremendous transforming power of that work in the life of a believer. Soon I lost contact with the lecture, and my mind turned back to my childhood when I had seen the radical change in the lives of my brothers Bob and Bill through the power of the gospel. I relived my own conversion—to me such a miraculous thing—and the subsequent chain of events through which I lost my singing voice and turned more and more to writing.\n\n“My thoughts raced on to the flights over the Himalayas, the spectacular power of God revealed in those electrical storms, the majesty of the mountains themselves, the incredible variety of the jungle, and thestar-filled nights of dazzling beauty high in the air.\n\n“As these scenes flashed through my memory, I began to focus on the element of the miraculous in all of God’s work, creation, and redemption. The words of a song were forming in my mind, and before the class period was over, the chorus was all thought out. I hurried over to the music building, found a vacant studio, and started to write:\n\nMy Father is omnipotent\nAnd that you can’t deny; etc.\n\n” [When the song was finished,] with a sigh of satisfaction I hummed the tune over a few times and then tucked it into a folder with some other compositions. Soon afterward Mr. Loes told me he had mentioned my work to Percy Crawford.” For the fit-st 28-year period of the copyright, that initial $40 was all Peterson received for a song that earned many thousands of dollars for the publishers. But the copyright law allows the composer to regain his rights to a song for the renewal period, so now he owns his most popular work.\n\nPeterson also wrote the tune TORONTO, which appears in SDAH 578\n “So, Send I You.”",

    "yearWritten": 1623,
    "historicalContext": "John Milton was 15 years old, living at his father’s house in Bread Street, London, and attending St. Paul’s Cathedral School for boys, when he wrote this hymn in 1623. Making metrical versions of the psalms was, in this era, a normal exercise for a person who had a religious inclination. This is a paraphrase of Psalm 136, the original having 24 two-line stanzas, each one ending with the refrain “For His mercies aye endure, ever faithful, ever sure.” Verses 1, 7, 25, and 26 of the psalm are used: “O give thanks unto the Lord,” “To Him that made great lights,” “Who giveth food to all flesh,” “O give thanks unto the God of heaven.” The SDAH hymn uses Milton’s first, seventh, twenty-second, and a repetition of his last stanza, with a change of one word—then. The hymn first appeared in Poems of Mr. John Milton, Both English and Latin, 1645.\n\nMilton was born on December 9, 1608, in London. He received his M.A. from Christ College, Cambridge, in 1632. Discouraged from entering the ministry because of conflict between church and state authorities, he chose to become a poet and spent the next six years at home studying and writing. Some of his later writing was very critical of the current political-religious scene. During this period he wrote Il Penseroso, L’Allegro, Comus, and Lycidas. Under Cromwell he had the position of secretary for foreign tongues in the Council of State. At age 44, in 1652, he became blind, but was able to continue his work until Cromwell stepped down in the Restoration of 1660. Milton escaped the gallows because of his fame as a poet.\n\nThe work for which he is best known, Paradise Lost, was published in 1667, and Paradise Regained in 1671. He wrote 19 metrical psalms that were not intended to be sung, but several have been included in hymnbooks. It is felt that his greatest contribution to hymnody was the influence he had on the hymns written by John and Charles Wesley. He died November 8, 1674.\n\nMONKLAND was named for the village in Herefordshire, England ‘ where John Wilkes was the organist. He had found the tune in Hymn Tunes ofthe United Brethren, 1 824, a Moravian hymnal that had been edited by John\n\nLees, organist at Leonninster Moravian Church. Wilkes’s arrangcmcnt was used in IIY1nns Ancient and Modern, 1861. The tune was originally composed by Moravian John Antes and is found in A Collection of Hymn T’vnes Chiefly composed for Private Amusement by John Antes, c, 179().\n\nJohn Antes was born March 24, 1740s in Frederick, licnnsylvania, into one of the most influential Moravian families of that time. A naturally gifted musician, he attended the boys’ school in Bethlchcm, He crafted a number of music instruments; one of his violins is in the Museum of the Moravian Historical Society at Nazareth, Pennsylvania, In 1764 he studied at the Moravian center at Herrnhut, Saxony; and after ordination in London, 1769, he spent 1 1 years as a missionary to Egypt. Here he suffered physical beatings at the order of the Turk, Osman Bey, who was trying to extort money from him. In 1783 he went to England and served the Moravian congregation at Fulneck, Yorkshire, for 25 years before retirement in 1808.\n\nAntes is considered to be the first American-born composer of chamber music (his string trios are of exceptional quality), and the first missionary to go out from the American colonies. He composed anthems, chorales, hymn tunes, and beautiful solo songs. A most versatile man, he was also an inventor and watchmaker. He died in Bristol on December 17, 1811.\n\nJohn Bernard Wilkes (1823-1869), considered by most hymnologists to be the arranger of the tune, was educated at the Royal Academy of Music, London. After serving ‘as organist at two churches, he went to Monkland in 1860, where Sir Henry W. Baker was the pastor. Baker was the chief editor of Hymns Ancient and Modern, so it was only natural that Wilkes would be called upon to make a musical contribution to that work. Wesley Milgate, author of Songs of the People of God, 1982, says that the John Wilkes who arranged this tune was not the John B. Wilkes above, but a less-noted organist who died in 1882.",

    "historicalContext": "This metrical version (see SDAH 16) of Psalm 42 was included in Tate and Brady’s New Version of the Psalms of David, London, 1696 (see SDAH 139). It is a paraphrase of verses l, 2, and 11. The original had six double stanzas of four lines each, and no doxology, So the present hymn is one quarter of the metrical psalm, but considered the best part by centuries of hymnbook editors.\n\nThe historian John Julian records that there were some 326 different metrical psalters, by all kinds of poets and theologians, including Queen Elizabeth, Lord Bacon, and Philip Sidney. Few of them enjoyed a very good rating, and most of them would be considered by present standards of poetic quality as downright terrible! It is understandable why, as a teenager, Isaac Watts was unhappy with the singing of the psalms in church!\n\nThe tune MARTYRDOM has an intriguing history. About the end of the eighteenth century it was first printed on single sheets for use in music classes in connnnon, or 4/4, time. In 1825 Robert A. Smith arranged it in 3/4 time and published it in Sacred Music Sung in St. George’s Church, Edinburgh, where he called it an “Old Scottish Melody.” Two years later it appeared in The Seraph, a Selection of Psalms and Hymns, Glasgow, again in triple time, with a footnote: “The above tune FENWICK or MARTYRDOM, and by some called DRUMCLOG, was composed by Mr. Hugh Wilson, a native of Fenwick.” After Wilson’s death, a legal battle over who really owned the copyright turned up evidence that he was entitled to be the legal owner. Later research by the noted specialist in the correlation of British folk tunes to hymn tunes, Anne G. Gilchrist, showed that Wilson may have arranged it from the traditional Scottish secular air, “Helen of Kirkconnel.” At any rate, the longevity of the tune can almost certainly be credited to Smith’s lovely version in 3/4 time that we have now.\n\nOther names by which this tune has been known are AVON and ALL SAINTS. With the exception of the upper c in the third line, the melody, like so many Scottish airs, is in the pentatonic (five-note) scale.\n\nHugh Wilson was born in 1766, in Fenwick, Ayrshire, Scotland. He became a shoemaker after his father; later he learned to construct sundials, and worked as a master draftsman and calculator. As a talented amateur musician, he often led the singing of the psalms at the Secession Church in Fenwick. He was the cofounder of the first Sunday school in the church in the town of Duntocher, on the north bank of the Clyde. Strangely, while on his deathbed, August 14, 1824, he gave instructions that all his manuscripts be destroyed. MARTYRDOM and one other tune, CAROLINE, are the only tunes of his that have survived.\n\nRobert Archibald Smith was born November 16, 1780, in Reading, Berkshire, England, the son of a weaver who returned with his family to Scotland when Robert was 20 years old, As a boy Robert was naturally musical, becoming accomplished on the cello and violin, and at age 23 a music teacher. From 1 807 he served as precentor (song leader) and session clerk at the Abbey Church in Paisley. In 1823 he went to St. George’s Church ‘ Edinburgh, where he was the leader of psalm singing and where he edited the book Sacred Music, mentioned above. One of his most significant works was the compilation of Scottish songs in his six-volume The Scottish Minstrel’ 1820-1824. He died January 3, 1829.",

    "historicalContext": "This hymn first appeared in Oratory Hymns, 1854, William Faber, in eight four-line stanzas under 1854, the title by “Come Frederickto Jesus. It began “Souls of men! why will ye scatter?” In 1862, in his Hymns, Faber had added five more stanzas, From the total of 13 stanzas, SDAH uses Nos. 4, 6, 8, and 13.\n\nFaber was born to Calvinistic parents at the vicarage at Calverley, near Leeds, Yorkshire, on June 28, 1814. He began studies at Oxford in 1833, obtaining his B.A. in 1836 and an M.A. in 1839. Ordained deacon in the Anglican Church in 1837, he manifested his zeal for the church by writing a pamphlet in 1838 that denounced certain practices of the Roman Catholic Church. However, he was much influenced by John Henry Newman and supported the Oxford movement, which sought to restore ritual and ceremony to the worship service. Faber toured Europe in 1 843 and on his return was appointed rector of the small village of Elton in Huntingdonshire (now Cambridgeshire). He was a splendid preacher, but began to introduce Roman Catholic practices into his church, such as penance and private confession. In 1845 he visited Rome and Florence, and was received into the Roman Catholic Church, taking the name Wilfrid. He formed a group known as the Wilfridians, which in 1848 moved to the Oratory of St. Philip Neri in Birmingham, where Newman was. They moved to London in 1849, establishing the London Oratorians, which in 1854 founded Brompton Oratory in southwest London. Faber was greatly impressed by the success of the Olney Hymns and those of Charles Wesley, and sought to introduce such congregational singing into the Roman Church. His first book, in 1849, contained 1 1 hymns; this was followed by Jesus and Mary in two editions, 1849 and 1852, and then by the two mentioned earlier, in 1854 and 1862. He also wrote poems and devotional works. In 1854 he received a D. D. degree from the pope. Faber also wrote SDAH 304, “Faith of Our Fathers.”\n\nWELLESLEY was composed in 1877 by Lizzie Shone Tourjee, later Estabrook (1858-1913), as a graduation song when she was a student in Newton High School, Massachusetts. She attended Wellesley College, Massachusetts, and her tune was used there. In 1900 Hamilton C. MacDougall, professor of music at the college, compiled a songbook and included this tune, using the name given to it by her father, Eben Tourjee. The elder Tourjee, of Huguenot ancestry, was musical director at the Methodist Church.",

    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "During the season of Advent, from December 17 to 23, the church in the ninth century, or even earlier, sang the seven ‘co” antiphons, one each day at vespers, before and after the singing of the Magnificat. An antiphon is a responsive singing of a portion of a psalm or scripture by alternate choirs; these are called the “O” antiphons because each begins with a long-drawn-out “O,” followed by a designation of our Lord in one of His titles. The “O” was an indication of an earnest longing for the advent of our Savior. In the twelfth century, these antiphons were collected into Latin verse and from this, John Mason Neale (1818-1866; see Biographies) translated them into an English metrical version. His first effort appeared in his Mediaeval Hymns, 1851, although several revisions were made later. The original began: “Draw near, draw near, Emmanuel”; of the seven titles of our Lord, namely, Wisdom, Lord, Root of Jesse, Key of David, Dayspring, King desired, and Emmanuel, Neale used five, omitting Wisdom and King.\n\nSDAH’s second and third stanzas complete the seven “O’s”; they were translated in 1916 by Henry Sloane Coffin. He was born January 5, 1877, in New York City, graduated from Yale University, and became a Presbyterian minister. He was president of Union Theological Seminary for many years, and a teacher of hymnology. He was author of several books dealing with current religious concerns. He died November 25, 1954.\n\nVENI EMMANUEL is typical of the plainsong that was the customary form of singing in the early Christian church. The music had no bar lines, the rhythm and accent being determined by the words. It was in unison, all singing the melody, and not intended to be harmonized nor to be accompanied by a musical instrument. The melody was unearthed in 1966 by Mother Thomas More (Mary Berry) in the Paris National Library in a small fifteenth-century Processional used by a community of French Franciscan nuns. The antiphonal effect in this present hymn may be obtained by one section singing the stanzas and a second section responding with the refrain’ the melody of which, with the exception of the first two notes, is an exact replica of the first two lines of the plainsong.",

    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "This fest is taken from hymn No, 9 in Cathemerinon, by the great Spanish poet Prudentius. That is a collection of 12 long hymns, ranging from 80 to 220 lines each. Prudentius wrote them to be sung, one at each hour of the day, reminding the believer that Christ is the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. From this poem several lines were taken to form a short Latin hymn entitled “Corde natus ex parentis, ante mundi exordium” (Born Out of the Heart of the Father, Before the Beginning of the World).\n\nJohn Neale (see Biographies) made a translation of six stanzas in The Hymnal Noted, 185 1, and printed it with Revelation 1:8 at the heading: “1 am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.” The “evermore and evermore” refrain and the final doxology stanza were not a part of the original, but were added by later use in the church service.\n\nHenry Baker (see SDAH 20) made his translation of nine stanzas for use in the preliminary edition of Hymns Ancient and Modern, 1 859, of which SDAH makes use of 1, 4, and 9.\n\nAurelius Clemens Prudentius (348-c. 413) was born in Spain to a wealthy family. He studied law and became a judge. At age 57 his self-centered life weighed heavily on his conscience, and he gave up the good life and entered a monastery. The remainder of his life was spent in meditation, prayer, and writing sacred poetry. His poems were meant for private devotions, but sections of them were appropriated for use in church.\n\nThe tune DIVINUM MYSTERIUM (Divine Mystery) originated in a medieval “trope,” which was actually a vocalized ornamentation on a single syllable of a word, usually the final “a” of alleluia. Later, creative spirits made special sets of words for these ornamentations. The tune was first discovered by Thomas Helmore in Piae Cantiones (Pious Songs), 1582, a collection made by Didrik Pedersen, a Finnish student at the University of Rostock. Helmore, the music editor, printed it in his The Hymnal Noted, 1852, with Neale’s translation. Earlier it had appeared in the twelfth to the fifteenth centuries in Germany and Italy, with the words Divinum mysterium, hence the tune name.\n\nThe arrangement SDAH uses was made for the Hymnal 1 940, by Winfred Douglas (see SDAH 72). It is to be sung in unison, with a rather free movement that goes along with the natural rhythm of the text.",

After years as a teacher and principal at the College of Dormans, Beauvais, he became rector of the University of Paris. He is considered to be the outstanding Latin author to come from France. Two volumes of his poems were published in Paris in 1755. He died in Paris on June 20, 1749. His other hymn in SDAH is No. 333, “On Jordan’s Banks the Baptist’s Cry. “\n\nThe translation by John Chandler appeared in his Hymns of the Primitive Church, 1837. His text has been altered many times.\n\nJohn Chandler was born June 16, 1806, in the parsonage at Witley, Surrey, England. He studied at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and was ordained in the Church of England in 1 831. When his father retired, he took over as pastor at Witley, and served there for most of his life. It was his opinion that “modern” hymns were unsuitable to sing along with the ancient prayers that were a part of the service, so he translated older hymns from the Latin. In addition to the book mentioned above, he published Hymns of the Church Most Primitive in 1841, the hymns for which were in large part taken from the Paris Breviary. Chandler died at Putney on July l, 1876. He also translated SDAH 333, “On Jordan’s Banks the Baptist’s Cry.\n\nThe name FESTAL SONG comes from the tune’s first wedding to the text “Awake and Sing the Song” in John Ireland Tucker’s The Hymnal with Tunes Old and New, 1 872 (Episcopal). But after the first time it was used with Merrill’s “Rise Up, O Men of God” (see SDAH 615), that combination of words and music seemed to be inseparable, The SDAH Committee thought FESTAL SONG to be also eminently suitable for this stirring text.\n\nWilliam Henry Walter was born on July 1, 1825, in Newark, New Jersey. As a boy he was organist in both the Presbyterian 1825, in Newark, and EpiscopNewal churches of that city. At age 17 he went to New York City, and had an outstanding career as organist in the Church of Epiphany, St. John’s Chapel’ St, Paul’s Chapel, Trinity Chapel, and at Columbia University, where he received the DMus. in 1864. His compositions include Masses, services’ and anthems. He published A Manual Of Church Music, 1860; Chorals and Hymns; Hymnal With Tunes Old and New, and other books of church music. He died in New York City in the year 1893.",

    "historicalContext": "In the Middle Ages all the singing inside the church was clone by the priests. However, outside the church the people gave vent to their emotions and sang their semi-sacred songs in the vernacular, based mainly Bible stories and characters. From this practice there grew up the carol or ring dance which was less formal than a solemn religious chant and performed in a freer, relaxed atmosphere. The words were made up spontaneously by the leader and fitted, as far as possible, to the rhythm of the music. This accounts for the irregular meter of this hymn and also for the slight inaccuracies; e.g., it describes the shepherds as seeing a star shining in the east. What they saw was the angel of the Lord (Matt. 2:8, 9). The Wise Men were in the east when they saw the star, and obviously saw the star in the west. The star was not visible continuously “both day and night,” for the Wise Men “rejoiced with exceeding great joy” (verse 10) when they saw it again standing over the house where Mary and Joseph and the Babe then were. The words are found in Davis Giddy’s (later Gilbert) Some Ancient Christmas Carols, 1823, but the words with the tune are taken from William Sandys’ collection of Christmas Carols, 1833. But both words and music are of much older origin, at least from the seventeenth century. There were nine stanzas.\n\nTHE FIRST NOEL first appeared in Sandys’ collection; the name may be from the French nouvelles or news, that is, “good tidings.” Another origin suggested is that the sound is the echo of the last two syllables of Emmanuel, the prophetic name for the child Jesus (Matt. 1:23). Yet another traces it from nada/ or natalis, i.e., birthday. The melody is very easy to learn and to sing, for it is almost a complete succession of notes separated by a single interval; in other words, a series of scale passages, ascending or descending, or portions thereof. The four exceptions are a drop of a fourth, which occurs three times, and a rise of the same interval once. William Sandys was born in London on October 29, 1792, and died in London on February 18, 1874. He was called to the bar in 18 14 and engaged in a law practice, but is chiefly remembered for his interest in carols and his revival of carol singing.",

    "historicalContext": "This poem was written in 1816 by James Montgomery (1771-1854), and printed in the December 24 issue of the newspaper Sheffield Iris, when he was a member of the staff. The title was “Nativity.” It first appeared in print as a hymn in Thomas Cotterill’s Selection of Psalms and Hymns, eighth edition, 1819. It was printed in Montgomery’s Christian Psalmist, 1 825, with very few changes but a different title, namely: “Good Tidings of Great Joy to All People.”\n\nREGENT SQUARE was composed specially for a hymn by Horatius Bonar (see SDAH 79) entitled “Glory Be to God and Father,” in Psalms and Hymns for Divine Worship, 1867, of which Henry Thomas Smart was the music editor. This was a Presbyterian hymnal edited by James Hamilton, minister of St. Philip’s Presbyterian Church in Regent Square, London. Smart named the tune after the location of his church, which is known as the “cathedral of London Presbyterianism.” Smart had been organist there for five years.\n\nSmart, born October 26, 1813, in Marylebone, London, had a musical father. As a boy he was very much interested in organ construction and in playing the organ. He was mainly self-taught, and after practicing law for four years, gave that up and devoted his life entirely to music. Unfortunately, his sight began to dim at the early age of 1 8, but nevertheless he was appointed as organist in Blackburn in Lancashire. After five years there, he received other appointments, all in London, as church organist in several different places. One of them was St. Philip’s, where he served for seven years. In the early 1860s he became blind, but his remarkable memory and his gift for improvisation and composition enabled him to retain his position as organist for another five years. Smart designed and built organs, was a music critic and music editor, and composed numerous cantatas and two operas. He is chiefly remembered, however, for his tunes contributed to Hymns Ancient and Modern, 1861, for his organ music, and for his church choral music. He died in Hampstead, London, on July 6, 1879.\n\nAnother tune by Smart is LANCASHIRE, SDAH 619.",

Josiah Gilbert Holland was born July 24, 18 19, in Belchertown, Massachusetts. He prepared for a career\n\nmedicine, and practiced for a short time in Springfield, Massachusetts. Changing to literary pursuits, he joined the Springfield Republican as author of the “Timothy Titcomb” letters, and helped to start Scribner’s Magazine, serving as its editor for 11 years until his death in New York, October 21, 1881. His Complete Poetical Writings was published in 1879.\n\nThe tune CHRISTMAS SONG was composed by Karl Pomeroy Harrington during a vacation at his summer cottage in New Hampshire in July 1904. It was included with this text in the 1905 Methodist Hymnal, for which he served as musical editor with Peter C. Lutkin (see ST)AH 669). Born June 13, 1861, in Somersworth, New Hampshire, Harrington was educated at Wesleyan University (B.A., 1882; M.A., 1885), and became a well-known teacher of Latin, filling posts at Wilbraham Academy, Wesleyan University, University of North Carolina, and the University of Maine. He usually served as organist in churches nearby, and in turn was director of the Festival Chorus, Bangor, Maine; founder and director of the Chapel Hill Choral Society, North Carolina; and director of the Middlesex Musical Association. He was a member of the committee and musical editor for the 1935 Methodist Hymnal, edited six hymn and song collections, and wrote the book Education in Church Music, 1931. He wrote many unpublished songs, anthems, and responses. He died at Berkeley, California, November 14, 1953.",

    "historicalContext": "The traditional text of this spiritual was in two stanzas:\n\nWhen I was a seeker\nI sought both night and day.\nI asked the Lord to help me,\nAnd He showed me the way.\n\nHe made me a watchman\nUpon a city wall,\nAnd if I am a Christian,\nI am the least of all.\n\nThere seems to be some confusion among hymnologists about the authorship of the present three stanzas. John Wesley Work, Jr. (1872-1925), published it in his Folk songs of the American Negro, 1907, and some say he gave credit for the authorship to his brother, Frederick J. Work, a collaborator on the book. William J. Reynolds says in his book Companion to Baptist Hymnal, 1976, on the basis of his personal friendship with John Wesley Work Ill (1901-1967), that the text now used was written by the father, John W. Work, Jr. We are indebted to Reynolds for the following biographical details:\n\nJohn W. Work, Jr., was born August 6, 1872, and educated in Nashville, Tennessee, graduating from Fisk University with a B.A. in 1895 and the M.A. in 1898. After teaching Latin and Greek at Fisk for a time, he became chairman of the Latin and History departments in 1906. At a time when the music of the Blacks was considered to be substandard and unacceptable, he was unswerving in his determination to study, preserve, develop, and perform this distinctive heritage of his people. For some 18 years he conducted musical groups and sang the spirituals that had been so much a part of his life. In 1909 he organized the Fisk Jubilee Quartet and directed the Fisk Jubilee Singers, who had earlier achieved fame while touring the nation and making recordings for Victor and Columbia. He published the book credited to him above and Alew Jubilee Songs as Sung by the Fisk Jubilee Singers, 1901. Two years before his death on September 7, 1925, he accepted the presidency of Roger Williams University, Nashville.\n\nJohn W. Work Ill made the harmonization of this spiritual. The oldest of seven children, he was born June 15, 1901, in Tullahoma, Tennessee, and was educated from elementary school through college at Fisk. He continued his study of music at Columbia University, New York, and at Yale University. Following his father’s tradition, he came back to Fisk, where he directed the nationally acclaimed Men’s Glee Club and the Fisk Jubilee Singers (1948-1957), which his father had directed from 1901 to 1916. Besides his skillful and sensitive arrangements of the spirituals, he wrote orchestral and choral works and a choral cycle, Isaac Watts Contemplates the Cross, 1964. Other publications include American Negro Songs and Spirituals 1940, and articles on Negro music and jazz for The Harvard Dictionary of Music. He died at Nashville, May 18, 1967.\n\nGeorge Pullen Jackson, in his book White and Negro Spirituals, calls attention to the similarity of this verse melody to the tune “We’ll March Around Jerusalem,” found in the New York Revivalist, 1868. It also echoes Stephen Foster’s “Oh, Susanna.” The refrain is very much like “Tramp’ Tramp, Tramp, the Boys Are Marching,” giving credence to the belief Of some that the spirituals, or parts of them, were borrowed from well-known songs popular at the time, John W, Work taught it to his choir for caroling around the campus, and said it was very possible that the music was the creation of his brother, Frederick.\n\nWith the exception of the final note of each stanza, the melody of refrain and stanza is in the pentatonic (or five-note) scale, so typical of the medium for folk melodies and spirituals.",

    "historicalContext": "This hymn by Charles Wesley (1707-1788; see Biographies) appeared first in John and Charles Wesley’s Hymns and Sacred Poems, 1739, under the title “Hymn for Christmas Day.” There are 10 stanzas of four lines each, beginning:\n\nHark, how all the welkin rings\nGlory to the King of kings.\n\nIn 1753 this was changed to the present wording by George Whitefield; since then, other minor alterations have been made, including, in 1782, the repetition of the first two lines as a refrain.\n\nThe tune MENDELSSOHN is part of the second movement of Festgesang an die Kunstler (Festival Song for the Artists), composed by Jakob Ludwig Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy (1809-1847; see Biographies), for the Gutenberg Festival in Leipzig in 1840 to commemorate the 400th (approximately) anniversary of the invention of printing. It was arranged as a hymn tune in 1856 by William Hayman Cummings to Flt Wesley’s words and named in honor of the original composer. Mendelssohn himself prophesied— falsely, as it turned out—that while singers and hearers might like the tune, it would never be appropriate for sacred words.\n\nWilliam Cummings was born on August 22, 183 1, in Sidbury, a village near the Devon coastal town of Sidmouth. As a boy he was a chorister at St. Paul’s Cathedral in London and later in the Temple Church. In 1 847 he was appointed organist at Waltham Abbey, and in that year he sang in the performance of Mendelssohn’s Elijah, conducted by the composer. He was noted as a successful tenor soloist and from 1879 to 1896 was professor of singing at the Royal Academy of Music. He conducted the Sacred Harmonic Society and in 1 896 was chosen to succeed Joseph Barnby as principal of the Guildhall School of Music, retaining that position until retirement in 1911. The University of Dublin accorded him an honorary D.Mus. degree in 1900. He composed one cantata, but was recognized as an authority on the life and works of Henry Purcell (see SDAH 607). Cummings died at Dulwich, south London, in June, 1915.",

    "historicalContext": "William Chatterton Dix was slowly recovering from a serious illness in his home in Bristol, England, in early 1858. On Epiphany Sunday, January 6, he was reading the story of the Wise Men and realized that there were valuable lessons implied there for our own Christian witness. Later in the day he put his thoughts into five stanzas of this hymn, which underline the present-day application of the story, that we should be led to Jesus, offer our treasure to Him, and willingly adore Him. The hymn was written to be used at St. Raphael’s Church, Bristol, and was later printed in 1861 in Dix’s Hymns of Love and Joy.\n\nDix was born in Bristol, England, on June 14, 1837, and was named after the famous “boy poet” Thomas Chatterton, for whom his father had great admiration. He studied at the local grammar school and then became an insurance agent in Glasgow. However, he pursued his hobby of writing, putting into verse some hymns translated into English from Greek and Abyssinian, and also some original hymns. The latter were published in his Hymns of Love and Joy, 1861; Altar Songs, 1867; A Vision of All Saints, 1871; and Seekers of a City, 1878. On retiring, he went to live with a daughter at Clifton, Bristol, and died at Cheddar, Axbridge, Somerset, on September 9, 1898. He contributed SDAH 141, “What Child Is This?” and SDAH 167, “Alleluia! Sing to Jesus!”\n\nDIX was named after the writer of the words; Dix himself actually disliked the tune, but finally accepted the very popular combination of words and music. Composed in 1 838 by Conrad Kocher, the tune was published in Kocher’s Stimmen aus dem Reiche Gottes (Voices From God’s Kingdom) and set to “Treuer Heiland, wir sind hier” (True Savior, We Are Here). Originally there were seven lines of music, the sixth line of melody being exactly one fourth higher than line 5. SDAH’s tune was revised by William Henry Monk (1823-1889; see SDAH 50) in 1861. He simplified the ending of the fifth phrase and hence the original sixth, and omitted the original fifth line altogether.\n\nConrad Kocher was born in Ditzingen, near Stuttgart, Germany, on December 16, 1786, At the early age of 17 he went to St. Petersburg (now Leningrad) as a tutor, but hearing there the music of Haydn and Mozart, he decided to pursue a musical career, He returned to Germany in 181 1 and had some of his works published, which resulted in the publishing house sponsoring Kocher’s study of music in Rome. He came in touch with Palestrina’s works, and this inspired him to attempt a reform of German church music. He founded a school of Sacred song in Stuttgart in 1821, which had a wide and stimulated four-part singing in the churches. He was organist of the Stiftskirche in Stuttgart from 1 827 until retirement in 1865. The University of Tubingen honored him with a Ph.D. degree in 1852. He wrote two operas; one oratorio, (‘The Death of Abel”; some sonatas; and a treatise on church music. He also compiled a large collection of chorales. He died at Stuttgart on March 12, 1872.\n\nThe unison setting here of DIX is by Melvin West (1930- ). For a four-part setting, see SDAH 565, (For the Beauty of the Earth)",

Actually, it can be found in no German hymnal prior to a Lutheran collection published in 1934 in Missouri. In 1945 Richard Hill, in an article “Not So Far Away in a Manger: Forty-one Settings of an American Carol,” in Music Library Association Notes, December issue, capably proved that it could not have been authored by Luther. First publication was in Little Children’s Books for Schools and Families, 1885. It was the second publication that probably started the myth. J. R. Murray’s Dainty Songs for Little Lads and Lasses sets it to his own tune with the caption “Luther’s Cradle Hymn. Composed by Martin Luther for his children, and still sung by German mothers to their little ones.” This was taken as authentic by many later hymnals.\n\nThe version with an added third stanza first appeared in 1 892 in Gabriel’s Vineyard Songs, published by Charles H. Gabriel (see SDAH 435), a famous and successful gospel song composer. Methodist hymnologist Robert McCutchan quotes a story from Bishop William Anderson in which he says it was Written at his invitation by John Thomas McFarland (1851-1913), then secretary of the Methodist Board of Sunday Schools in New York. Anderson Wanted to use the hymn for a Children’s Day program and wished three stanzas instead of two. McFarland’s office was close by, and he went there for privacy to write. Within an hour he brought the finished stanza. The dates given for this occurrence vary from 1904 to 1908, several years after first publication in 1892, mentioned above. So the mystery about authorship of this carol continues, but that does not diminish our enjoyment of it.\n\nCRADLE SONG was composed for this text by William J. Kirkpatrick (1838-1921; see Biographies), that energetic and prolific camp meeting song leader and composer of many favorite gospel songs. While he was director of music at Grace Methodist Episcopal Church, Philadelphia, in 1895, he printed the carol in a pamphlet of seven songs entitled Around the World With Christmas. It is perhaps the charming quality of this tune that has helped it to find acceptance in several hymnals in England.",

    "historicalContext": "Christina Georgina Rossetti was born December 5, 1830, in St. Pancras, London, the daughter of an Italian refugee who became a professor at King’s College, London. Her first verses of poetry were published by her grandfather when she was 12. Her brother, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, a famous poet and painter, used her beautiful face as a model for the virgin Mary in his painting Ecce Ancilla Domini.\n\nThis sensitive hymn about the birth of Jesus is one of four Christmas Poems in her Poetical Works, 1904, which carries the note “written before 1872,” and was titled “A Christmas Carol.” It began life as a hymn in the English Hymnal, 1906 (Church of England), and has been used by many hymnals since that time, continuing to gain in popularity. The last line Originally was “Yet what I can I give Him, Give my heart.”\n\nChristina twice broke off proposals of marriage, once because her fiancé became a Catholic. As a result of this sorrow and a lingering illness, she sought and found comfort in her sincere religious devotion. She died on December 29, 1894.\n\nThe tune name UINTA (pronounced “you-IN-ta”) is the middle name of the composer’s wife, Harriet Uinta Schwender-Hooper; of their daughter, Janice Uinta Hooper-Lind; and of Harriet’s mother, Esther Uinta Clark- Schwender. It is also the name of a tribe of American Indians, and a range of mountains in Utah.\n\nThe music was composed by Wayne Hooper (1920- ), especially for the Hymnsingers, a group made up of the King’s Heralds Quartet, whose music has been heard on the Voice of Prophecy radio broadcast for more than 50 years, beginning in 1937; Del Delker, contralto soloist since 1947 on the same program; and Maurita (Bunny) Phillips-Thornburgh, music teacher, clinician, choral director, and soloist with the Roger Wagner Chorale and other choirs and orchestras in America and Europe. It was first published in a little book of Christmas carols titled The First Noel, which was offered in 1964 as a gift to all who sent contributions for the support of this international radiobroadcast of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.\n\nThe tune associated with this text in most hymnals is CRANHAM, by the great English composer Gustav Holst (see SDAH 224), which is given as an alternate tune.",

    "historicalContext": "Both words and music of this traditional carol from Poland are thought to date from the thirteenth century. SDAH notes the meter as “Irregular,” but it could be counted as 8.7.8.7.8.8.7.7., the same as SDAH 128, ERMUNTRE DICH. However, the two are not interchangeable, because of a difference in the musical phrasing and where the accents fall. Based on a typical Polish folk dance rhythm, W ZLOBIE LEZY feels more like 4.4.7.4.4.7., etc., because all of the eight-syllable phrases are broken up by the music and rhyming scheme into two phrases of four syllables each, such as “swift are winging, angels singing.” Its popularity is undoubtedly a result of this very natural rocking lullaby rhythm or two eighth notes followed by two quarters, and these interior rhyming schemes.\n\nThe English version of the carol was first published in a monthly magazine, Music and Youth, of which Edith Reed was the editor, 1923-1926. Its first appearance in a hymnal was in England in 1926, in School Worship’ edited by George Thalben-Ball and published by the Congregational Union of England and Wales. Note that each stanza ends with a practical application, first for all, then a personal one.\n\nEdith Margaret Gellibrand Reed was born in Islington, London, in 1885. She was educated at Clifton High School, St. Leonard’s School, St. Andrews’, and the Guildhall School of Music, An associate of the Royal school of Organists, she devoted her whole life to making music more attractive to children, writing and editing several books and magazines toward this goal. Some of her publications were The Music Student, Panpipes, and Story Lives of the Great Composers. She died June 4, 1933.\n\nThe tune name W ZLOBIE LEZY comes from the first line of the original Polish carol, and means “in manger lies.” The musical arrangement is by the committee that prepared The Australian Hymn Book, 1977.",

    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "Four of the five creative people who had a hand in the present version of this hymn were named “Johann” or “John,” and the fifth was Johnson! The hymn was first published in Johann Rist’s Himmlische Lieder (Heavenly Songs), 1641. Johann Rist was born March 8, 1607, in Ottensen, near Hamburg, Germany. Dedicated to the Lord by his pastor-father, Rist studied theology at the University of Rinteln. While tutoring for a family in Hamburg, he studied medicine, and later combined spiritual and physical healing in his ministry. While he was a Protestant pastor at Wedel, near Hamburg, the Thirty Years’ War occasioned much suffering; he lost all his personal property, including his musical instruments and the organ in his church. He wrote some 680 hymns on nearly every theological subject, and was crowned poet laureate by Emperor Ferdinand Ill in 1644. Six collections of his hymns were published from 1641 to 1656, as well as secular plays and poems. He died August 31, 1667.\n\nJohn Troutbeck, born November 12, 1832, in Blencow, England, translated Bach’s Christmas Oratorio from German to English for Novello and Company, London; this first stanza is from that work. He was a graduate of Oxford, precentor of Manchester Cathedral, and chaplain to the queen. Death came in London October 11, 1899.\n\nThe original poem in German had 12 eight-line stanzas; the SDAH’s first stanza is number 9, with the music as harmonized and used by Bach in his Christmas Oratorio. SDAH’s second stanza first appeared in Hymns for the Family of God, 1976, and was written by Norman E. Johnson, who was born July 4, 1928, in Smolan, Kansas, and went to Bethany College at Lindsborg. While attending North Park Seminary, Johnson was staff musician at radio station WMBI, Chicago. A master’s degree in church music was conferred on him by the University of Southern California. He served as youth director and organist at Covenant Church, Turlock, California; minister of music at Evangelical Covenant Church of Grand Rapids, Michigan, for 17 years; senior music editor of Singspiration, Inc., for 20 years; and assisted in editing several llYIÄM1als published from 1964 to 1979. A member of the Covenant Hymnal ConMÄ1ission, he contributed two texts, five tunes, and 25 arrangements to that book. HC died at Grand Rapids, Michigan, December 19, 1983.\n\nThe name ERMUJNTRE DICH comes from the German hymn’s first line, ”Ermuntre dich mein schwacher Geist” (“Be cheerful, my faint heart”). The tune, originally written in 3/4 time, was first published with Rist’s text in his book mentioned above. Johann Schop, the musical editor for the book, was probably born at Hamburg, Germany, about 1590. He became an accomplished performer on the organ, violin, Jute, trumpet, and trombone in the court orchestra at Wolfenbuttel. In 1621 he was appointed director of municipal music at Hamburg, and organist at St. James’ Church. He wrote a large body of cantatas and instrumental music, and many hymn tunes for his friend Johann Rist, which were appreciated and used during his time. His most famous melody is the one used by Bach in his “Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring.” His death dates vary from 1664 to 1667. The harmonization is by J. S. Bach (1685-1750).",

    "historicalContext": "This text was written and first published with Katherine Davis’s arrangement of the tune in a two-part anthem, published by Galaxy Music Corporation, New York, 1942. It is based on Luke 2, verses 8-14.\n\nA person well known to American choir singers, Katherine Kennicott Davis was born June 25, 1 892, in St, Joseph, Missouri. At Wellesley College in Massachusetts, she earned the B, A. degree, then did graduate study in music composition, theory, and piano before becoming a teacher at her alma mater. Following an eight-year period of teaching in private schools, she went into full-time work as a composer, editor, and arranger. Probably her most famous text is s ‘The Little Drummer Boy,” 1941. She sometimes used the pen names John Cowley and C. R, W. Robertson. Her published works, numbering more than 80(), include piano books; a folk operetta; a Christmas cantata,\n\n“This Is Noel”; a one-act opera; and many choral pieces and arrangements. Acknowledging her creativity and accomplishments, Stetson University in Florida conferred on her an honorary doctorate. Failing eyesight forced her to stop composing in 1977, and her final days were spent in Concord, Massachusetts, where she died April 20, 198(). Her valuable personal library was given to the Choristers Guild, and is on permanent loan to the University of Lowell, Massachusetts.\n\nThe name PUER NOBIS NASCITUJR comes from the first phrase of a fifteenth-Century Latin carol, usually translated “Unto us a boy is born.” Many variants of the tune have been found, but in the present form it first appeared in Finland in Theodoricus Petri’s Piae Cantiones, 1582, a collection from which G. R. Woodward published in English his Cowley Carol Book in 1902. For another form of this tune, see SDAH 333, PUER NOBIS.\n\nThe music of the hymn in SDAH is just the first page of Geoffrey Shaw’s arrangement in Oxford Book of Carols, 1928, in which each of the five stanzas has a different treatment. The use of these varied harmonizations would add a spark to any performance of this carol.\n\nGeoffrey Turton Shaw, born November 14, 1879, in Clapham, London, England, was a choral singer at St. Paul’s Cathedral. An organ scholar at Cambridge University, he studied under two great musicians, Charles V. Stanford (SDAH 32) and Charles Wood. He became inspector of music for the schools of London, and followed his brother, Martin Shaw (SDAH 28), in 1920 as organist at St. Mary’s, Primrose Hill. His hymn tunes and arrangements are found in the English books Songs of Praise, 193 1, and Congregational Praise, 1953. He assisted in the editing and publishing of a number of songbooks, and was keenly interested in preserving and using folk melodies. He retired in 1940 and died in London April 14, 1943.",

    "historicalContext": "This hymn was written by Edward Hamilton Sears in 1846 but was put aside because of the ill success of a previous Christmas poem. Then under the title ”Peace on Earth” it was sent to the publisher of the Boston Christian Register and appeared in the issue of December 29, 1849. Sears Wrote hymns to summarize his sermons so that their message would be remembered. This principle is demonstrated in this hymn; based on Luke 2:13, 14, it draws a modern lesson from the song of the angels on the first Christmas day.\n\nSears was born on April 6, 1810, in Sandisfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts. In his boyhood he was an apt versifier; on one occasion, to prove that he was the author of two verses of poetry he had chalked on his hat while at play, he wrote a third verse on the spot. He attended Union College, Schenectady, New York, graduating in 1834, and then Harvard Divinity School. He gained his D. D. in 1837. He became a Unitarian minister and held several pastorates in the Boston, Massachusetts, area. He served first at Wayland in 1838, then at Lancaster in 1840, back to Wayland in 1847, and then in 1865 at nearby Weston, where he died on January 16, 1876. He was the associate editor of the Monthly Religious Magazine, in which most of his hymns appeared. He wrote some religious books as well as his Sermons and Songs in 1875, and preached the divinity of Christ at a time when Unitarians Were emphasizing the social gospel.\n\nCAROL, which means to dance in a ring, is an appropriate name for this Christmas hymn. It is an arrangement of Study No. 23 from Church Carols and Choir Studies, by Richard Storrs Willis in 1850. Willis was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on February 10, 1819, and studied in the Boston Latin School of Yale, graduating in 1841. He was active in many musical organizations and spent six years in Germany, studying musical composition. There he became a close friend of Felix Mendelssohn and later published his biography. Returning to New York in 1848, he took up journalism and served as a music critic for the New York Times from 1 848 to 1852, and for the Musical Times from 1852 to 1864; he was editor of the latter for some years. He also published other books on music,and composed anthems and secular songs. He lived in Nice, France, from 1 874 to 1878, but returned to Detroit, where he had gone in 1861, and died there on May 7, 1900 Willis also arranged _SDAH 240, CRUSADER’S HYMN.\n\nThe arrangement of CAROL was made by a Brooklyn organist, Uzziah Christopher Burnap (1834-1900), D, Mus, who also composed SDAH 389, HINCHMAN. (For biography of Burnap, see SDAH 389.)",

    "historicalContext": "This anonymous poem, probably dating from the fifteenth century, is inspired by the prophecy of Isaiah I: I, “And there shall come forth a rod out of the stern of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots.” For the poet, it was only a tiny step from talking about Christ as a tree to talking about Him as a lovely rose, The earliest appearance of the original German text is in a manuscript from St, Alban’s Carthusian monastery in Trier. It belonged to a Brother Conrad, a Carthusian monk of Mainz, Germany, and was written between 1582 and 1588, It was first published in Alte Catholische Geistliche Kirkengesånge (Old Catholic Spiritual songs for the Church), 1599, in 23 stanzas. The familiar translation, which has been used in a number of choral arrangements, is by Theodore Baker (1851-1934; see SDAH 8), who was well known as a scholar and music editor for G. Schirmer, New York.\n\nES IST EIN ROS (There Is a Rose) is a German Rhineland carol that was also first published in Cologne with this text in the book mentioned above. It is sometimes called ROSA MYSTICA, The SDAH setting is from Praetorius’ Musae Sionaes, 1609. Undoubtedly, the staying power of this appealing tune is found in its rhythmic variety—four quarter notes, then three half notes, followed by a syncopated combination of both, It is in the common AABA form, but the B section is a short little “afterthought” that makes the whole delightful.\n\nMichael Praetorius (a Latinized form of Schulz) was born February 15, 1571, in Kreuzburg, Germany. He began his career as bandmaster at Luneburg; in 1594 he moved to Wolfenbuttel to be organist, then bandmaster and private secretary to the duke of Brunswick. In addition to his many compositions, Praetorius is remembered for his Musae Sionae, 16 volumes of sacred music published between 1605 and 1612; Musa Aonia, nine books of secular music; and a staggering accomplishment for the time, his Syntagma Musicum, a three-volume encyclopedia of musical knowledge, which included a complete survey and analysis of all the music and instruments noted in the Bible.

    "historicalContext": "The oldest manuscript in which these words are to be found is one copied and signed by John Francis Wade (c.1711-1786) about the year 1743.Six other copies by the same hand are known dated between 1746 and 1761 and may indicate that Wade was the author. There were four stanzas in this English version, but four others were added so that the complete Latin text in Thesaurus Animae Christianae (Treasury of Christian Lives), undated, consists of eight stanzas, of which SDAH has Nos. 1,7, and 8.\n\nThe SDAH translation was made in 1841 by Frederick Oakeley; its revised form was first published in F. H. Murray’s A Hymnal for Use in the English Church,1852. A prose translation of the fifth stanza is: “Though of eternal origin, we shall behold His eternal splendor veiled in flesh; God, a little child wrapped in shabby clothes.”\n\nJohn Francis Wade was born in England in 1710 or 1711; he is described in his obituary,1787, as “a layman, aged 75, with whose beautiful manuscript books our chapels, as well as private families, abound, in writing which and teaching the Latin and church song he chiefly spent his time. He lived in Douay, in northern France, where many English Catholics fled following the arrival of William of Orange to become king of England after James II abdicated in 1688. Wade conducted a music-copying business in this city and died there on August 16, 1786.\n\nFrederick Oakeley was born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, on September 5, 1802.He was educated privately and then at the University of Oxford, graduating in 1824 with a B.A. He was ordained in the Anglican Church in 1826, but after hearing a sermon the next year on the Anglican Prayer Book he became a follower of the Oxford movement. He was appointed as prebendary at Lichfield Cathedral in 1832, preacher at Whitehall in 1837, and minister of Margaret Chapel, London, in 1839. His theological views leaned more to High Church practices; in 1845 he resigned and joined John Henry Newman, and was accepted into the Roman Catholic Church in 1845. He was reordained and worked for several years among the poor in Westminster; in 1852 he became a canon there. He transferred to Islington, north London, as a parish priest and died in that suburb on January 29,1880.\n\nADESTE FIDELES (Come Near, Faithful Ones), also called PORTUGUESE HYMN, appears in Wade’s Cantus Diversi (Various Songs) of 1751 as a manuscript copy; its first printed form was in Hymns for Catholic Services, 1766. Samuel Webbe (1740-1816) printed it in its present time signature in his An Essay on the Church Plain Chant, 1782. The tune was used in the Portuguese embassy chapel in London. The duke of Leeds heard it there and used it later at concerts under the name PORTUGUESE HYMN, assuming that it came from that country. Webbe was organist at the chapel, and his publication made the tune well known. The composition of the melody has been ascribed to John Reading, organist of Westminster College, in 1680. Another tune from Wade’s Cantus Diversi is SDAH 211, HOLYWOOD. Webbe also arranged the tune named CONSOLATOR (see SDAH 477).",

    "historicalContext": "There were six five-line stanzas in the original of this poem, attributed to Valentin Thilo (1607-1672), who was professor of rhetoric at the University of Königsberg, Germany, for 28 years. During this period he was elected dean of the Philosophical Faculty five times, and twice the rector of the university. Nearly all his hymns were written for the festivals of the Christian year. This hymn was published in Samuel Scheidt’s Görlitzer Tabulaturbuch, 100 chorale settings he prepared for the town council of Gorlitz in 1650.\n\nO JESULEIN SÜSS (O Sweet Little Jesus) was first published in a Catholic book in Cologne, Germany, 1623.J. S. Bach’s (1685-1750; see Biographies) version of the tune, with a figured bass, was printed in the Schemelli Gesangbuch, 1736, a collection of 954 spiritual songs and arias. The preface to this work says that this one was “improved in the thorough bass by J. S. Bach” (he changed the bass line, the foundation upon which the total harmony was improvised). We are indebted to E. Harold Geer for both the translation of the text and the harmonization.\n\nAfter quite a search, this combination of text and tune was found in only one book, Hymnal for Colleges and Schools, Yale University Press, 1956, of which Geer was the editor.\n\nE. Harold Geer was born in 1886 at Tabor, Iowa. He began the study of violin at age 5, and was educated at Doane College in Nebraska and Oberlin College in Ohio. He studied organ and composition with Widor in Paris, and T. Tertius Noble in America. Before going to Vassar College (for women), Poughkeepsie, New York, he held posts as a college teacher and church organist in Ohio, Michigan, and Massachusetts. He went to Vassar as assistant professor of music, and stayed for 36 years, teaching organ, playing\n\nfor chapel, and directing the Vassar College Choir, for which he arranged more than 100 pieces for women’s voices.\n\nHis insistent emphasis on the selection of superior music had a great influence in improving the musical taste of the students who sang it and heard it. Music for the regular chapel service was meticulously prepared and beautifully performed. His annual traditional Christmas program always attracted large audiences. He was kind and had a keen sense of humor, yet was always frank and outspoken. Even those who disagreed with him never for a moment doubted the sincerity of his convictions. His final work published was a book, Organ Registration in Theory and Practice, 1957. He died at Christmas of that year.",

    "yearWritten": 1868,
    "historicalContext": "Phillips Brooks made a visit to the Holy Land in 1865 and was in Bethlehem on Sunday, December 24. In the evening he went to the spot where, according to tradition, the angel appeared to the shepherds. Then from 10:00 p.m. on Christmas Eve until 3:00 a.m. on Christmas morning, he attended the service in the Church of the Nativity at Bethlehem. The music and the scenes so impressed him that a new carol was faintly formed in his mind. He did not commit it to paper, however, until several years later when he wrote five stanzas especially for his Sunday school.\n\nBrooks was born in Boston on December 13, 1835. He graduated from Harvard in 1855, returning for a brief, unsuccessful period to the Boston Latin School where he had been a pupil. He then studied at the Theological Seminary in Alexandria, Virginia, and was ordained in the Episcopal Church in 1859. He became rector of the Church of the Advent in Philadelphia, where his preaching was so effective that he was called to Trinity Church in the same city. He remained there until 1869. He then accepted a call to Holy Trinity Church in Boston, where he ministered until 1891, when he became bishop of Massachusetts. He died on January 23, 1893, at Boston. Brooks was a powerful preacher; his lectures on preaching were widely circulated both in the United States and Great Britain, as were also his published sermons. The University of Oxford granted him an honorary D.D. degree in 1885.\n\nBrooks gave his poem to Lewis Henry Redner, his church organist at Holy Trinity Church in Philadelphia. Redner had previously asked his pastor to write a text, to which he would provide a tune. On Christmas Eve he fell asleep, and woke after a few hours with the present tune ringing in his ears. He jotted it down quickly on paper at his bedside, and harmonized it in the morning, ready to be sung in his Sunday school on December 27, 1868. The hymn was first printed in 1874 in The Church Porch, a hymnal for the Sunday school prepared by William R. Huntington, who named the tune ST. LOUIS, using a different spelling of the composer’s name to avoid embarrassment.\n\nRedner was born on December 14, 1831, in Philadelphia. In his teens he entered the real estate business, succeeding so well that soon he owned his own business and became a wealthy man. He always kept his interest in spiritual things and was organist in several churches before serving at Holy Trinity from 1861 to 1864, after which he was superintendent of the Sunday school chapel attached to the church. He died on August 29, 1908, in Atlantic City, where he had gone to recuperate from an illness.",

    "historicalContext": "Germany during the fourteenth century. A traditional story tells about a vision that came to one Heinrich Suso, fourteenth-century mystic, in which a choir of angels sang this carol to him, and then drew him in to dance with them. The text was macaronic, that is, a mixture of Latin language and some vernacular language. John M. Neale (1818-1866; see Biographies) included his translation in Carols for Christmastide, 1853, with this tune. It was an inexpensive collection of 12 carols that he hoped to make available to church choirs. The original first line, “Good Christian men, rejoice,” has been changed to “Good Christians, now rejoice” to make the language inclusive of people of both genders.\n\nThe tune name IN DULCE JUBILO means literally, “In sweet shouting, or jubilation, or joyful noise.” It has been found at Leipzig University Library in a manuscript dating from around 1400. The melody and certain versions of the words appeared in several sixteenth-century hymnbooks, including a Swedish translation of Piae Cantiones, 1582.\n\nThe Hymnal 1940 Companion relates how “the macaronic character of this text was fully tested on September 14, 1745, at the Moravian mission in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where the mission diary records that it was sung simultaneously in 13 languages, European and Indian.”\n\nThe arrangement is by C. Winifred Douglas (1867-1944), prominent Episcopal hymnologist (see SDAH 72).",

    "historicalContext": "Both words and music of this Christmas carol were written in 1857 by John Henry Hopkins and appeared in his Carols, Hymns, and Songs, 1863. Objection has been raised to the words in that the Wise Men are not called kings in the Bible, neither is their number given. However, the three gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh imply three givers. They possibly signify three aspects of our Lord’s life on earth, namely gold for kingship, frankincense for worship, and myrrh for sacrifice, representing Him respectively as king, priest, and lamb.\n\nHopkins was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on October 28,1820, and educated at the University of Vermont, where he graduated in 1839.He spent time as a reporter and continued his study of law, gaining his M.A. in 1845. He then studied at the New York City General Theological Seminary and graduated in 1850. He was the first instructor there in church music, from 1855 to 1857. He founded the Church Journal of the Episcopal Church in 1853 and remained its editor until 1868. After he was ordained in 1872, he was rector of Trinity Church, Plattsburgh, New York, for four years. He then transferred to Christ Church, Williamsport, Pennsylvania. In addition to his musical talent, he designed stained-glass windows. He died at Troy, New York, on August 14, 1891.\n\nBy its name, the tune KINGS OF ORIENT recalls the seventh-century tradition that says that the gold was brought by the old man Melchior, the frankincense by the ruddy youth Kaspar, and the myrrh by the swarthy, dark-skinned Balthasar. The music for the stanzas is in the minor key, the refrain then modulating to the relative major key.",

    "historicalContext": "Few of the Negro spirituals have to do with the nativity of Christ. This has given rise to some speculation. James Weldon Johnson, noted Negro historian and poet, felt that the reason lay in the fact that Christmas Day was a day of special license, having no religious significance to the slaves. On the other hand, Howard Thurman in his article “The Meaning of Spirituals,” published in the International Library of Negro Life and History, offers that, in relating the Bible stories concerning the birth of Jesus, great caution was exhibited in teaching the meaning of this event to the poor and the captive. Why? It is of primary significance that Jesus was born of poor parentage, so poor that His parents could not afford to offer a lamb for the sacrifice but had to use doves instead. It is also noteworthy that Jesus was not a Roman citizen. He was a Jew who lived under Roman rule. He was of low status because of His race. Similarly, the African slave was not a citizen of America. One can imagine the heartening and revitalizing effect that Christianity would have offered the slave, also poor and of a hated race, if Jesus had been introduced to him as the hope of the disinherited and the captive!\n\nNevertheless, there are a few Christmas spirituals that have evolved and that point out the meaning of the birth of Jesus. “Rise Up, Shepherd, and Follow” is one of these. It captures the same spirit inherent in the parables of the pearl of great price and the treasure hidden in the field, as its words enjoin the believer to leave all his possessions-his sheep, his lambs, his ewes, his rams-and to follow the star to the place where he can find the true Pearl, the greatest Treasure of all, Jesus!\n\nThis is not one of those spirituals that can be found in the standard collections, nor is it in the first-line index of the Dictionary of American Hymnody. The arrangement is by Alma Blackmon (1921-; see SDAH 69), who furnished the above commentary. She also arranged SDAH 305, “Give Me Jesus,” and 580, “This Little Light of Mine.”",

    "historicalContext": "This hymn about the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem was written in 1700 by Nahum Tate, who was then poet laureate of Britain. It is a metrical version of Luke 2:8-14, using as much as possible of the actual words of the Authorized Version. (For an example of metrical conversion, see SDAH 16.)\n\nNahum Tate (originally Teate) was born in Dublin in 1652, the son of an Irish minister. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, and settled in London in 1672, where he wrote plays for the London stage, most of them being translations or adaptations of the work of other writers. He was appointed poet laureate in 1692 by King William III. His main claim to fame comes from his work with Nicholas Brady on the Tate and Brady Psalter, 1696, also known as the New Version of the Psalms of David. (The Old Version, by Sternhold and Hopkins, 1562, had maintained a monopoly on psalm singing for about 150 years!) These new metrical versions of the psalms seemed to move in the direction of more freedom of “human composure.”\n\nIncluded in the supplement authorized by the queen in 1703 were paraphrases of the Lord’s Prayer, the Ten Commandments, the Apostles’ Creed, Canticles (or songs), this hymn from the book of Luke, and five more based on the New Testament. These were all departures from a centuries-held policy that only the psalms were worthy to be sung in church. As an example of the prejudice against this New Version, Tate himself told how, when he was at family prayers in the home of a friend, one of the young girls explained her refusal to sing by saying, “If you must know the plain truth, sir, as long as you sung Jesus Christ’s psalms, I sung along with ye; but now that you sing psalms of your own invention, ye may sing by yourselves!” But once this Net Version gained a foothold, it served the church for 200 years. Tate was an intemperate man, and wound up in a debtor’s refuge in London, where he died on August 12, 1715.\n\nNicholas Brady was also an Irishman, born October 18, 1659, at Bandon, County Cork. He was educated at Oxford and Dublin universities. Ordained in 1688, he worked as a pastor in several churches in Ireland and England, and was chaplain to William III, to Mary, and to Anne, both as princess of Wales and as queen. He died at Richmond, Surrey, on June 20,1726. Another hymn from Tate and Brady’s Psalter is SDAH 113, “As Pants the Hart.”\n\nWINCHESTER OLD is one of the well-used common meter tunes to which psalms were sung, and appeared in the sixteenth century. It is first found in Este’s Psalter of 1592, where it is set to Psalm 84 in his Whole Booke of Psalmes. The name George Kirbye is attached to his tune, indicating that he was the arranger, for the melody is found in a work by Christopher Tye entitled Acts of the Apostles, Chapter VIII, 1533. Tye, born about 1500, was a chorister, choir leader, ordained minister, and doctor of music who greatly influenced English church music. He died at Doddington in the Fen district, near Petersborough, in March 1573. George Kirbye was born about 1650 in the county of Suffolk. He lived at Rushbrooke in the same county, and was buried on October 6, 1634, at Bury St. Edmunds. Thomas Este or East was a music publisher who lived from the mid-1500s to the early 1600s, and issued works of Elizabethan madrigals as well as metrical psalm tunes. In his book this tune was not named, although three other tunes are named for the first time. The name WINCHESTER was given to it by Thomas Ravens-croft in 1621; the addition of OLD was given after 1847 when a different tune was named WINCHESTER NEW.",

    "historicalContext": "This hymn was written by Emily Elizabeth Steele Elliott and printed privately in 1864 for the choir and the children of the parish school of St. Mark’s Church, Brighton, England, where her father was the rector. It was later published in 1870 in the Church Missionary Juvenile Instructor, a magazine that she edited for six years. The words are a homily on the text “There was no room for them in the inn” (Luke 2:7).\n\nEmily Elliott was born in Brighton, Sessex, on July 22, 1836, at her father’s rectory. She was an enthusiastic mission worker and a capable poetess. She wrote 70 hymns and poems in her Chimes of Consecration, 1873, and 71 hymns in her Chimes for Daily Service, 1880. She died at Islington, north London, on August 3, 1897.\n\nMARGARET was composed especially for this hymn by Timothy Richard Matthews and first published in Children’s Hymns and Tunes, 1876. He was born in 1826 in Colmworth, a small village near Bedford, Bedfordshire. He was educated at Cambridge University, graduating in 1853. Ordained in that year, he was appointed as curate at St. Mary’s, Nottingham. In 1859 he moved to North Cotes in Lincolnshire, near Grimsby. Ten years later he became rector of the same church, serving until his retirement in 1907. He composed church music and more than 100 hymn tunes, many of which appear in his Congregational Melodies, 1863. He also compiled The North Cotes Supplemental Tune Book. His last home was in Tetney, a larger village near North Cotes, where he died on January 5, 1910.",

Other hymns by Dix in SDAH are No. 123, “As With Gladness Men of Old,” and No. 167, “Alleluia! Sing to Jesus!”\n\nGREENSLEEVES appeared in New Christmas Carols, 1642, with a carol for New Year’s, “The old year now away is fled.” Much earlier, the registers of the Stationers’ Company, London, September 1580, recorded a license to one Richard Jones, “A New Northern Dittye of the Lady Greene Sleeves.” The same day a license was issued to Edward White for “A Ballad, Being the Ladie Greene Sleeves Answere to Donkyn His Frende.” Twelve days later another version, with sacred words, was recorded: “Greene Sleeves moralized to the Scripture, declaring the manifold benefits and blessings of God bestowed on sinful man.” The fact that it appeared in several versions over so short a time period indicates a popularity dating much earlier. William Shakespeare made mention of the GREENSLEEVES tune in The Merry Wives of Windsor.\n\nThe arrangement used in SDAH is from the Episcopal Hymnal 1940.",

    "historicalContext": "Jan R.H. de Smidt wrote a book in 1932, Les Noels et la Tradition Populaire (Noels in the Popular Tradition), in which he gives the opinion that this traditional French carol, both text and tune, dates from the eighteenth century. It was first found in Nouveau recueil de cantiques (New Collection of Hymns), 1855. The English translation is by Henri Frederick Hemy, published in Crown of Jesus Music, Part II, 1862.\n\nThe practice of singing part of the words in the vernacular and part in Latin is called “macaronic.” “Gloria in excelsis Deo,” or “Glory to God in the highest,” is a direct quote from the earliest recorded Christian hymn of praise, voiced by the angels who appeared to the shepherds announcing the birth of Jesus: “Glory to God in the highest” (Luke 2:14). The carol was first used in the Eastern Church as a morning hymn.\n\nHenri Frederick Hemy was born November 12, 1818, at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England, of German parents. He was a church organist who also taught music at St. Cuthbert’s College, Upshaw, in Durham. Besides the book mentioned above, he published the very successful Royal Modern Tutor for the Pianoforte, 1858. He died at Hartlepool in 1888. Hemy also composed the tune to SDAH 304, ST. CATHERINE.\n\nThe adaptation SDAH uses was made by Earl Bowman Marlatt in 1937. Born May 24, 1892, at Columbus, Indiana, Marlatt earned the B.A. from DePauw University in 1912 and the Ph.D. from Boston University in 1922. After graduate study at Oxford and the University of Berlin, he taught literature and religious education at Boston University and at Wellesley, then was dean of the School of Theology at Boston University from 1938 to 1945. He was associate editor of the American Student Hymnal, 1928, and published several volumes of poetry.\n\nThe French traditional melody GLORIA (also known as IRIS) has always been wedded to this text. The arrangement is by Edwin Shippen Barnes, born September 14, 1887, at Sea Bright, New Jersey. He graduated at Yale and studied under the great organist Louis Vierne in Paris before serving in Presbyterian churches in New York; Philadelphia; and Santa Monica, California. He retired to the beautiful mountain community of Idyllwild, California, in 1954. He donated a small organ to the church there and played until his death in 1958.",

    "historicalContext": "On December 24, 1818, in Oberndorf, a village near Salzburg, Austria, the organ at St. Nicolaus Church failed to function. Joseph Mohr, the assistant priest, decided to write a new hymn for the Christmas Eve service and to accompany it on his guitar. He wrote the words of this Christmas carol, in German, of course, in three stanzas of six lines each, and took it along to Franz Gruber, asking him to write a tune for it. Gruber was the schoolmaster at the neighboring village of Arnsdorf, and also the parish organist. Strangely enough, a few days prior to this, the two men had been discussing music and concluded that a perfect Christmas song had never been written. In the very short time available before the service the tune was composed. In the church that evening Mohr sang the tenor part and played the guitar accompaniment; Gruber sang the bass, and a choir of girls from the village repeated the last two lines of each stanza in four-part harmony. The carol was not published for 20 years, but it became known through the organ builder Karl Mauracher, from Zillertal, 80 miles distant. He came to repair the organ, heard the carol, secured a copy, and took it back with him and introduced it in his district. There it became very popular, and for a time was thought to be a folk song of the Austrian Tyrol. There have been many translations of the song; the one in SDAH was made in 1863 by John Freeman Young and published in his Great Hymns of the Church, 1887 (it had been published in 1871 with no credit for authorship given).\n\nJoseph Mohr was born at Salzburg, Austria, on December 11, 1792. He was a boy chorister in the cathedral and later attended the university there. He was ordained a Roman Catholic priest in Salzburg in 1815, and served as assistant in several parishes in the Salzburg diocese (including Oberndorf), none of them more than 16 miles from Salzburg. In 1828 he was appointed vicar at Hintersee, southwest of Salzburg, and then in 1837 at Wagrein, 35 miles to the southeast of Salzburg. He died there on December 4, 1848.\n\nThe tune STILLE NACHT (Silent Night) receives its name from the words for which it was specifically composed by Franz Xavier Gruber, who was born on November 25, 1787, at the village of Unterweizberg in upper Austria. As a small boy he worked with his father, a weaver, at the loom, but showed talent as a musician, an occupation that his father felt offered no prospects of earning a living. However, in the evenings Franz studied secretly with the local schoolteacher and organist, who taught him to play the organ. When he was only 12 years old the sudden illness of his teacher opened the way for him to substitute at the organ, which pleased his father so much that he permitted his son to study organ at Burghausen, near Salzburg. He became a teacher at Arnsdorf in 1807, remaining there until 1829, and for a time in 1818 was organist at St. Nicolaus Church in nearby Oberndorf. In 1829 he was appointed headmaster at Berndorf, southwest of Vienna, and then in 1833 as organist and choirmaster at Hallein, near Salzburg. There he founded the Hallein Choral Society, and he died there on June 7,1863.\n\nJohn Freeman Young was born on October 30, 1820, at Pittston, Maine, and trained in Wesleyan secondary school and college. He joined the Protestant Episcopal Church and trained for the ministry, being ordained in 1846. He served in Florida, Texas, Mississippi, and Louisiana, and then in 1860 moved to New York City as curate of Trinity Church. He was appointed bishop of Florida in 1867, holding that office until his sudden death from pneumonia on November 15, 1885, while on a visit to New York. His Great Hymns of the Church appeared posthumously in 1887.",

    "historicalContext": "This hymn was written in 1899, originally in four eight-line stanzas, each about a different geographical location related to Jesus’ life and ministry-Bethlehem, Nazareth, Galilee, and Calvary. The hymn is a partial answer to a need the author recognized for hymns about the earthly life and ministry of Jesus.\n\nLouis Fitzgerald Benson, minister, scholar, editor, poet, and hymn writer, was the preeminent American hymnologist of his day, a great leader in the improvement of public and private worship. Born July 22, 1855, in Philadelphia, he studied law at the University of Pennsylvania and practiced at the bar for seven years. Unable to resist a call to the ministry, he studied at Princeton Theological Seminary and was ordained in the Presbyterian Church in 1886. After six years as pastor in Germantown, Pennsylvania, he resigned and devoted the remainder of his life to editing a series of hymnals for the General Assembly of his church, including The Hymnal, 1895, and its revision in 1911, The Chapel Hymnal; and The School Hymnal. He wrote several books about hymns; The English Hymn is considered one of the most definitive on the subject. His extensive and valuable library of hymnology was presented to Princeton University upon his death. Benson died in Philadelphia, October 10, 1930.\n\nAccording to the Oxford Book of Carols, 1928, the tune KINGSFOLD was collected by Lucy E. Broadwood and printed in English Country Songs, 1893, to the words of “Dives and Lazarus,” but more probably it belongs to “Come, All You Worthy Christian Men.” In the Cowley Carol Book it was with a ballad beginning, “We are poor frozen-out gardeners,” and Benjamin Britten arranged it in one of his song collections with the Irish words, “The Star of County Down.” Kingsfold is a village in northwest Sussex.\n\nThis is one of the wonderfully singable folk tunes that Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872-1958; see Biographies) arranged and introduced into English Congregational singing. He liked it well enough to compose a fantasia for strings and harp called “Dives and Lazarus,” which is a “theme and variations” on various forms of this melody. As one gets acquainted with his creative arrangement of the hymn in SDAH, it will be noticed that score 1, score 2, and score 4, while having the same melody, each has its own harmonization. KINGSFOLD is also used for SDAH 465, “I Heard the Voice of Jesus.”",

    "historicalContext": "In the Christian year, Epiphany is usually celebrated on January 6, commemorating the coming of the Magi as being the first manifestation of Christ to the Gentiles. Bishop Christopher Wordsworth first published this Epiphany hymn recounting several manifestations of Christ’s divinity in his Holy Year, 1862, with this heading: “Sixth Sunday after the Epiphany: Recapitulation of the subjects presented in the services of former weeks throughout the season of Epiphany; and anticipation of the future great and glorious Epiphany, at which Christ will appear again, to judge the world.”\n\nChristopher Wordsworth was born on October 30, 1807, at Lambeth, England, and educated at Winchester and at Trinity College. A brilliant scholar in both the classics and mathematics, he was appointed a fellow, and classical lecturer, at Cambridge. Other career posts were headmaster of Harrow (1836); canon of Westminster (1844); and bishop of Lincoln Cathedral (1869-1884). A prolific writer, he produced a Commentary on the whole Bible. His poetical output was influenced by his uncle, poet laureate William Wordsworth, whom he often visited and corresponded with.\n\nChristopher Wordsworth’s Holy Year, noted above, contained hymns for every season of the year. Of these, 117 were his own; 82 hymns were from other sources. He considered hymns to be a valuable means of stamping permanently upon the memory the great doctrines of the Christian church. He drew his inspiration from Holy Scripture, and sought and found Christ everywhere in the New Testament. He felt that Gospel history was only the history of what “Jesus began to do and teach” on earth; the Acts of the Apostles and all the Epistles were the history of what He continued to do and to teach from heaven; and the Revelation (perhaps Wordsworth’s favorite book) was the seal of all. Wordsworth also wrote SDAH 382 and SDAH 383, “O Day of Rest and Gladness”; and SDAH 589, “Holy Spirit, Gracious Guest.” He died at Harewood, near Leeds, Yorkshire, on March 20, 1885.\n\nRILEY was composed by Martin Shaw (1876-1958; see Biographies) and printed in his Additional Tunes and Settings in Use at St. Mary’s, Primrose Hill, London, 1915, where he was the organist. The repeated notes at the ends of phrases give it a definite “Irish” flavor.",

    "historicalContext": "John Brownlie, in his Hymns and Hymn Writers of the Church Hymnary, 1899, quotes this story by Jemima Luke regarding the writing of this hymn:\n\n“I went in the year 1841 to the normal infant school in Gray’s Inn Road to obtain some knowledge of the system.... Among the marching pieces at Gray’s Inn Road was a Greek air, ‘Salamis’ the pathos of which took my fancy. ··. Having been recalled home, I went one day on some missionary business to the little town of Wellington, five miles from Taunton, in a stagecoach. It was a beautiful spring morning, it was an hour’s ride, and there was no other inside passenger. On the back of an old envelope I wrote in pencil the first two of the verses now so well known, in order to teach the tune to the village school, Blagdon, southwest of Bristol, supported by his stepmother, and which it was my province to visit. The third verse was added afterwards to make it a missionary hymn.”\n\nThe Greek tune that so impressed her was published with her words in the Sunday School Teacher’s Magazine, 1841. An arrangement of it by William Bradbury and Winifred Douglas under the name LUKE was in the Episcopal Hymnal 1940. The hymn is based, of course, on the story of Jesus blessing the children, recorded in Matthew 19:14, 15.\n\nJemima Thompson was born August 19, 1813, at Islington, north London, to a father who was responsible for founding the Sunday School Union and the Bible Society, and for supplying floating chapels for sailors. It was her fond hope to someday be a missionary to India, but a severe illness made the fulfillment of these plans impossible. She authored several books and religious articles for magazines. In 1843 she married a Congregational minister, the Reverend Samuel Luke. For a time she was a teacher in the school for infants mentioned above, and wrote songs for the children to sing. She died at Newport, Isle of Wight, February 2, 1906.\n\nEAST HORNDON (the name of an English village near Brentwood, Essex), is an old English traditional melody, arranged for these words in the English Hymnal, 1906, by Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872-1958; see Biographies).",

    "historicalContext": "Brian Arthur Wren (1936-; see Biographies) wrote this hymn concerning the Transfiguration while doing graduate study in theology at Mansfield College, England. The words are a paraphrase of the Transfiguration story as found in Mark 9.\n\nIn an interview published in The Hymn, April 1984, Wren says, “A hymn writer also needs to think in picture language. You try to give the reader a vehicle to ride in, … which gives a fresh view of the way and the destination. Next you need to control the picture language you use so that it is consistent and theologically sound.” Surely the graphic language he has chosen for this hymn paints for us a vivid picture: “Stands alone in glory blazing”; “Trembling at His feet we saw”; “Swift the cloud of glory came.”\n\nIt was only the second hymn he wrote, but already he showed a natural gift for powerful lyric expression.\n\nSydney Hugo Nicholson was born February 9, 1875, in London to an aristocratic family headed by Sir Charles Nicholson, the founder and first chancellor of the University of Sydney, Australia. Sir Charles named his son after this city, where he spent nearly 40 years. In this household, a musical career was considered to be menial and of doubtful future prospects, but Sydney rebelled and finally became one of the leading forces shaping English church music. His education was at Rugby, New College, Oxford, and the Royal College of Music, where he studied under Sir Charles Stanford (see SDAH 32). He served as organist at Barnet Parish Church (1897); Lower Chapel, Eton College (1903); Carlisle Cathedral (1904); Manchester Cathedral (1908-1918); and Westminster Abbey (1919-1927). In 1927 he retired to found the School of English Church Music at St. Nicholas College, Chislehurst, and devoted the rest of his life to its improvement and success. It is now called the Royal School of Church Music and is located at Addington Palace, Croydon. In 1938 he was knighted for outstanding service to English church music. He was a fellow of the Royal College of Organists and was awarded a D.Mus. degree by the archbishop of Canterbury. He died at Ashford, Kent, on May 30, 1947.\n\nNicholson’s musical life was closely bound up with the world’s most durable and successful hymnal, Hymns Ancient and Modern. In 1913 he became its musical editor, in 1928 he was the first layman to be a proprietor, and from 1938 to 1947 he was chairman. He was instrumental in broadening the musical horizons of this staid old book, including a few tunes Church of England congregations had not heard before. This tune, FENITON, is considered to be one of the finest tunes he wrote, with a sweeping dignity that seems to be made for singing in a vaulted cathedral. He marked it to be sung “slow,” which would certainly add to its effectiveness in such a spacious setting. Notice that the final score of the music is double, one staff for the singers and one for the accompaniment. The latter is written expressly for organ, but can be condensed for piano by playing the small notes. Nicholson also composed some hymns and anthems, songs, a comic opera, and books on musical topics.",

    "historicalContext": "This is a translation of four stanzas of Apparuit benignitas (Kindness Appeared), a hymn of 23 stanzas on the life of Christ, found in a fifteenth-century manuscript. Because the style of handwriting is similar to that of Thomas à Kempis, the attribution has been made to him. Stanza five is a doxology added by the editors of Hymns Ancient and Modern, 1860, replacing the one Webb translated from the lines of the original hymn. It is similar in some parts to the Nicene Creed, and incorporates many Scripture texts. Webb’s translation was made for the Hymnal Noted, 1851, and has been somewhat altered by editors since that time.\n\nThomas à Kempis was born c. 1380 at Kempen, Germany, to a family named Hamerken. His father was a peasant and his mother kept a school for the younger children of Kempen. At age 12 he entered a poor-scholars’ house connected to the Brethren of the Common Life at Deventer, Holland, a lay fellowship devoted to Christian service according to Christ’s example. After six years Thomas was received as one of the Brethren, and known as Thomas à Kempis (Thomas from Kempen). Going to the religious house of Mount St. Agnes, near Zwolle, Holland, he was ordained a priest in 1413. Most of his\n\ntime was spent in copying devotional works and writing a chronicle of the monastery of St. Agnes, tracts, and hymns. He is generally given the credit for writing the famous Imitatio Christi (Imitation of Christ). It was among the earliest books printed, and has been translated into more languages than any other book except the Bible. He died in 1471.\n\nBenjamin Webb was born in Addle Hill, very near St. Paul’s Cathedral, London, on November 28, 1819. He was educated at St. Paul’s School and Trinity College, Cambridge, and was ordained into the Anglican ministry. He served as assistant in three parishes before becoming curate of Sheen in Staffordshire. In 1862 he became vicar of St. Andrews, Wells Street, London, where composer Joseph Barnby (see Biographies) was organist and choirmaster. This church was famous for its excellent music. Webb’s final post was as prebendary at St. Paul’s Cathedral. He assisted in editing the Hymnal Noted, 1851, and The Hymnary, 1872, and wrote the text for a number of anthems. He was one of the founders of the Ecclesiological Society and edited their official organ for 26 years. He died at Marylebone, London, on November 27, 1885, one day before his sixty-sixth birthday.  This is one of the texts sent out by the SDAH Committee to some 30 SDA composers, asking for new tunes. Out of several submitted, INFINITE LOVE was chosen. James Bingham (1945-; see SDAH 54) gives this suggestion: “A somewhat conventional hymn tune, but inspired by the extreme pathos of the text. The hymn must not be hurried; it is reflective and awesome. The various ornamental notes will not sound rushed if this is kept in mind. Bingham is also the composer of SDAH 54, PHOS HILARON; SDAH 81,JANELLE; and SDAH 102,YOU YANGS.",

    "historicalContext": "Cecil Frances Alexander, née Humphreys (1818-1895; see SDAH 93), wrote this hymn based on the Apostles’ Creed in order to simplify it so that children could understand what they were reciting each Sunday. It appeared in her Hymns for Little Children of 1848 and amplifies article 3 of the creed, which, referring to the Lord Jesus Christ, says, “Which was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary.” The scripture on which it is based is Luke 2:7, which states how Mary goes to “the city of David, which is called Bethlehem” (verse 4), and “she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger.”\n\nIRBY was set first to these words in 1849 by Henry John Gauntlett in the pamphlet Christmas Carols, but as a melody only, with a simple piano accompaniment. He harmonized it in 1858 in Alexander’s Hymns for Little Children with the notable moving parts in the last two lines, and named the tune when it was included in Hymns Ancient and Modern in 1868. Lines 3 and 4 replicate the first two lines, but each of the four parts has an interesting part to sing. There are three places in England named Irby-Irby upon Humber, near Grimsby; Irby in the Marsh, near Skegness; and Irby in the Wirral, near Birkenhead-but it is not known if any of these were connected with the composer.\n\nHenry J. Gauntlett was born in Wellington, Shropshire, on July 9, 1805. At the early age of 9 he was organist at Olney in Buckinghamshire, where his father was the vicar. From age 14 to 20 he was even the choirmaster; among other things he conducted The Messiah during this period. His profession was law, and he practiced this from 1826 till 1842, but at the same time he was church organist successively in two London churches. Then he was appointed organist to the king of Hanover and was able to devote all his time to music. He was awarded the degree of D.Mus. (Lambeth) by the archbishop of Canterbury in 1843, and had the privilege of being organist for the first performance of Mendelssohn’s Elijah in Birmingham, conducted by the composer. He was very interested in psalmody and in Gregorian music, and compiled a book on each topic. He is credited with having composed about 10,000 hymn tunes as well as organ music, songs, and anthems. He died at Kensington, London, on February 21, 1876. Gauntlett also adapted tune SDAH 659, STUTTGART.",

Donald Hustad of Hope Publishing Company printed it with Hanby’s own tune in Worship and Service Hymnal, 1957, which is the version used by Baptist Hymnal, 1975.\n\nBenjamin Russel Hanby (1833-1867) was born the son of a bishop in the United Brethren Church, and became a minister of that church, with an emphasis on music ministry. He coedited Chapel Gems, 1866, with George F. Root (see SDAH 88) in Chicago, and wrote the lyrics for the popular “Darling Nellie Gray,” for which his sister composed the music. He died at the height of his creative powers, at age 34.\n\nRESONET IN LAUDIBUS (Let It Echo With Praises) is an old German carol tune usually associated with the Christmas carol “Joseph, Dearest, Joseph Mine,” found in the Oxford Book of Carols, 1928.

Also, its first appearance in print in America was in 1955 in the Chapel Conference Service Songbook, compiled by the chief of chaplains, U.S. Air Force, Washington, D.C. Hymnologist Leonard Ellenwood believes it is either a modern spiritual or a folk song of later America because of the late date of its appearance in print.\n\nWhatever its origin, it beautifully reflects the words of Isaiah 63:3-5: “I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was none with me. ·.. And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me. It is also a poignant reminder that each person will have to stand alone in the day of judgment-we will not be saved because of attachment to a group. One’s personal relationship with God will be the deciding factor.\n\nThe arrangement of the music is by Allen William Foster, a member of the SDAH Committee. He also served on the tunes subcommittee. Born January 1, 1940, at Camden, New Jersey, he received the B.A. from Temple University and the M.A. from Rutgers University. Having been introduced to formal piano study as a young child, Foster later developed a keen interest. in the organ and church music. He continued piano study at Philadelphia Conservatory of Music with Jon Carlin, and organ instruction with W. Franklin Hoxter, noted organ recitalist. For a number of years Foster was employed by the school district of Philadelphia as the coordinator of social services, early childhood division. At the same time his weekends were well filled, since he was organist at Ebenezer Seventh-day Adventist Church and Pinn Memorial Baptist Church, both in Philadelphia. He and his talented wife, Gwendolyn, worked with the student body at Pine Forge Academy from 1981, leading a choir that was chosen as the official choir for the Pan-American Youth Congress, Mexico City, in 1984.\n\nThrough the years Allen has worked in evangelism with E. E. Cleveland, Luther R. Palmer, Charles D. Brooks, and, in 1982, with SDA General Conference president Neal C. Wilson in the One Thousand Days of Reaping evangelistic crusade in Manila.  A number of his compositions and arrangements have been recorded by well-known choirs and artists, including the Ebenezer SDA Church Choir, on Chapel Records. Foster’s original tunes in SDAH are No. 203, CHALLENGE; No. 298, BRADLEY; and No. 417, FINALLY.",

She contributed verse to the church magazine and also edited a children\\’s magazine. In 1838 she sent a poem of four stanzas of eight lines each, entitled “He Is Our Peace,” of which the SDAH hymn is a modified selection. The full 32 lines were printed in the Church of England Magazine for March 3, 1858. Note that the word peace is mentioned five times in the three stanzas.\n\nTRYGGARE KAN INGEN VARA (see SDAH 101) is an old Swedish folk melody that could have had German origins. It is also said to be an old English folk song that was carried over to Sweden during the Pietistic revival of the latter half of the nineteenth century, when many English gospel songs made the same journey. The arrangement for SDAH was made by Melvin West (1930-; see Biographies).",

Strangely enough, a similar tribute was paid in reverse by Watts to Wesley concerning the latter’s “Come, O Thou Traveller Unknown.”\n\nThe tune HAMBURG was arranged in 1824 by Lowell Mason（1792-1872; see Biographies) from a gregorian chant, but the name has no associative significance.",

Cambridge University conferred the D.Mus. on him in 1786. He died at Doncaster, Yorkshire, September 11 or 12, 1807. Maintaining a keen interest in raising the standards of church music, he published many articles and collections, including Psalms of David Set to Music, 1774, and Thoughts on the Present Performance of Psalmody in the Established Church of England. Addressed to the Clergy, 1791. This tune was in his Psalms of David for the Use of Parish Churches, 1790, where it is described as “part of a melody taken from a hymn tune.” It is derived from a triple-time tune called TUNBRIDGE appearing in Aaron Williams’ Psalmody in Miniature, c. 1780. Miller noted that this would make a good Long Meter tune. It is named in honor of Miller\\’s friend and patron, the marquess of Rockingham, who was twice prime minister of Great Britain. Williams also contributed the tunes MEAR, SDAH 39, and ST. THOMAS, SDAH 344 and 372.",

    "historicalContext": "Bernard of Clairvaux persuaded Louis VII to launch the Second Crusade, but after its disastrous failure in 1149 he retired to a solitary life. Tradition says that during this period, while beholding a crucifix he had a vision in which the image of Christ came down from the cross and embraced him, showing that his devotion was accepted. This vision inspired him to write a long poem in seven parts, one intended to be used for each day of Holy Week, and each addressed to a different member of the physical body of Christ. Each part consisted of five stanzas of 10 lines, and was addressed to the feet, knees, hands, side, breast, heart, and face, respectively.\n\nIn 1656 Paul Gerhardt (1607-1676; see SDAH 57) translated the Latin hymn into German; the last section, “O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden” (O Head, Bloodstained and Wounded), was included in Johann Crüger’s Praxis Pietatis Melica (see SDAH 239) of that year. SDAH’s free translation originally had 10 tanzas; it was translated into English in 1830 by James Waddell Alexander and appeared in Joshua Leavitt’s The Christian Lyre, under the title “To the Suffering Face of Christ.”\n\nBernard was born in 1091 at his father’s castle, Les Fontaines,near Dijon, France, and was educated at Châtillon-sur-Seine, about 40 miles north of Dijon. Both his father, who was killed in the First Crusade, and his mother died by the time Bernard was 14. After distinguished and diligent study he decided to follow a religious life as a monk. With his uncle and two of his brothers he entered the first Cistercian monastery at Cîteaux in 1113, taking with him more than 24 friends. Two years later he founded the monastery at Clairvaux (“clear valley”) in the valley of the Aube, about 60 miles north of Dijon. He remained abbot there until his death, and exercised great political and religious influence. He was a noted preacher, theologian, and counselor to popes and kings. He died at Clairvaux on August 20,1153. Bernard also wrote the original Latin hymns SDAH 241, “Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee,” and SDAH 242, “Jesus, Thou Joy of Loving Hearts,” both translations from the lengthy original hymn.\n\nJames Waddell Alexander was born at Hopewell, Louisa County, Virginia, on March 13, 1804. He trained for the Presbyterian ministry at Princeton Theological Seminary. After graduating in 1827, he was appointed pastor in Charlotte County, Virginia, and then at Trenton, New Jersey. From 1833 until 1844 he was professor of literature and rhetoric at his alma mater. For the next five years he was pastor of the Duane Street Presbyterian Church in New York City, from 1849 to 1851 professor of church history and government again at Princeton, and finally pastor at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church in New York. Besides articles for the Princeton Quarterly Review, he wrote several books and translations of hymn texts, the latter being collected in The Breaking Circle in 1861. He died in Sweet Springs, Virginia, on July 31,1859.\n\nPASSION CHORALE was originally the air of a German love song that first appeared in Hans Leo Hassler’s Lustgarten neuer teutscher Gesänge (Pleasure Garden of New German Songs), 1601.The tune was set to a hymn in 1613 and to the words of this present hymn in 1656.\n\nHassler was born on October 25, 1564, at Nuremberg, Bavaria,95 miles north of Munich. He received his early training in music from his father Isaac, an organist. In 1584 he studied for one year in Venice, and then from 1585 to 1600 he was organist to Count Octavian II at Augsburg. On Octavian’s death in 1600 Hassler returned to Nuremberg as organist at the Frauenkirche and director of the town band.His ability as an organist was well known. In 1604 he married and moved to Ulm, west of Augsburg. In 1608 he was appointed as organist to the elector of Saxony in Dresden. He was a victim of tuberculosis, and while accompanying the elector to the imperial election at Frankfurt, died there on June 8, 1612. Hassler composed many sacred and secular choral works as well as works for the organ.\n\nThe tune is now named PASSION CHORALE because it was harmonized by Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750; see Biographies), in 1729 for his St. Matthew’s Passion, which was first performed at Leipzig on Good Friday of that year. Its name means a sacred song that tells of the suffering of our Lord as described, in this case, in the Gospel According to Saint Matthew.",

One of his selections was this hymn by James Montgomery (1771-1854; see Biographies).\n\nThe title of the hymn in the last revision is “Christ Our Example in Suffering,” which is borne out by the words of the last line in each stanza of SDAH: “Learn of Jesus Christ to pray, to bear the cross, and to die.”\n\nGETHSEMANE, so named because of the opening words, is also called PETRA (Rock) because it is so often associated with the words of the hymn “Rock of Ages.” It is prosaically called also REDHEAD NO. 76, for the simple reason that it is No. 76 in Richard Redhead’s Ancient Hymn Melodies and Other Church Tunes, 1853, a book that gave a tremendous stimulus to church music in the Anglican Church. Redhead, born March 1, 1820, was a boy chorister at Magdalen College, Oxford. From 1839 to 1864 he was the organist at Margaret Chapel in Cavendish Square, London. From 1864 to 1894, when he retired, he was organist at St. Mary Magdalene in Paddington. He was the editor of several other music books for use in the worship service of the church. He died on April 27, 1901, at Hellingly, Hailsham, Sussex.  Redhead also arranged, from an old French melody, the tune ORIENTIS PARTIBUS, SDAH 549.",

    "historicalContext": "This is perhaps the most universally used spiritual in all the hymnals of Cristendom. With a variant form of the first phrase, it first appeared in print in Old Plantation Hymns, compiled by William E. Barton in 1899. Frederick J. Work printed it with this traditional music in Folk Songs of the American Negro,1907.\n\nThe primary poetic analogy is that all of us were there at Calvary, by virtue of the fact that “all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God” (Rom.3:23).\n\nThe secondary analogy is in His suffering, especially for the slaves. The death of Jesus took on a deep and personal poignancy. It was not merely the death of a man or God, but there was a quality of identification in it that continued to burn its way deep into the heart of even the most unemotional. The suffering of Jesus on the cross was something more; He suffered, He died, but not alone, because in imagery they, the slaves, were with Him throughout all the phases of that agonizing death. They knew something of what He suffered. It was a cry of the heart that found an echo and response in their own woes.\n\nSometimes another stanza is added, “Were you there when He rose up from the grave?” The melody, except for the A-flat in the last line, is predictably in the pentatonic mode.",

    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "Both words and music of this very popular hymn were written in 1913 by George Bennard while a minister in the Methodist Episcopal Church at Albion, Michigan. During a real soul struggle he was meditating on the theme of the cross and the importance it occupies in Christianity. After further study and reading of the Scriptures, he saw Christ and the cross inseparably joined in the well-known verse,“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life”(John 3:16). The title words,“The Old Rugged Cross,”came into his mind, and then followed the melody. In vain he tried to fit words to the tune, trying on various occasions in different cities. Finally freedom of poetry came, and the words flowed freely from his mind. He sang the completed hymn at the parsonage of his friends, the Reverend and Mrs. L. O. Bostwick atPokagon, Michigan, and asked them diffidently, “Will it do?” Their answer was that they liked it so much that they would pay for its printing. The hymn was printed in Heart and Life Songs, 1915, edited by Bennard and two others.\n\nBennard was born on February 4, 1873, at Youngstown, Ohio, and was converted as a child in a Salvation Army meeting at Lucas, Iowa. When he was 16 years old his father died, and he supported his mother and four sisters. He moved to Illinois, married, and his wife worked for the Salvation Army. He resigned to become an evangelist in the Methodist Church, and conducted campaigns in Canada and in the north and central states of America. He died at Reed City, Michigan, on October 10, 1958. To commemorate him and his popular hymn the Reed city officials erected a wooden cross 12 feet high just outside the city.",

    "historicalContext": "It was suggested to Henry Hart Milman by his friend Reginald Heber (see SDAH 47) that he turn his remarkable literary and poetic talent to hymn writing. As a result, this hymn was written in May 1821, to be sung on the sixth Sunday in Lent, otherwise known as Palm Sunday, to commemorate the triumphal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem the week before the Passover, or Easter. There were originally five stanzas, the omitted one being:\n\nThe third line of the first stanza was changed in 1852 from “Thine humble beast pursues his road” to the present wording. The hymn was first printed in Heber’s Hymns Written and Adapted to the Weekly Church Service of the Year, 1827.\n\nMilman was born at St. James, London, on February 10, 1791, the son of the physician to King George III. He was educated at Eton and Oxford, and won prizes at the university of poetry and essays. He graduated with a B.A. in 1814, received his M.A. in 1816, and D.D. in 1849. He was ordained deacon in 1816 and priest in 1817; in the latter year he was appointed vicar of St. Mary’s, Reading. From 1821 to 1831 he was professor of poetry at Oxford, then from 1835 to 1849 canon of Westminster Abbey and at the same time rector of St. Margaret’s Church in the shadow of the cathedral. His last appointment was in 1849 as dean of St. Paul’s Cathedral. He died at Sunninghill, Berkshire, on September 24, 1868, and was buried in St. Paul’s Cathedral.\n\nMilman wrote several successful plays, but later wrote 13 hymns and many theological works. He caused a storm of controversy by writing his History of the Jews, 1829, using the Bible as though it were a secular book of history, but he by no means adopted the higher critical attitude of the German school of thought. He also wrote two histories of Christianity, one in 1840 and the other of a later period in 1854, both being highly acclaimed.\n\nCANNOCK was composed by Walter Kendall Stanton and is one of his 26 tunes that appeared in the BBC Hymn Book, 1951. He was born at Dauntsey, a village near Swindon, Wiltshire, England, on September 29, 1891. At the age of 10, he became a chorister at Salisbury Cathedral, then as a student at Lancing College, in Sussex, before going to Oxford as an organ scholar from 1909 to 1913. He was director of music at St. Edward’s School, Oxford, from 1915 to 1924, then at Wellington College from 1924 to 1937. Overlapping this period from 1927 onward, he was in a similar position at the University of Reading. He resigned these two positions to take up the directorship of music at the British Broadcasting Company, Midland Region. Then from 1947 to 1957 he was the first professor of music in this new department at the University of Bristol. He wrote 33 hymn tunes and composed mainly choral music. He died at Sedgehill, near Shaftesbury in Dorset, on June 30, 1978.",

    "historicalContext": "Written in 1875 by John Ellerton (1826-1893; see SDAH 56), this hymn was first used in that year’s edition of Hymn Ancient and Modern. John Julian says it is “the grandest of his original compositions.” He goes on to characterize John Ellertons’s hymns as having “words usually short and simple; thoughts clear and well stated; rhythm good and stately.” Meant to be sung in the Good Friday service, it is based on Matthew 27:45, 46.\n\nThe earliest appearance of AFRON (Heaven) is taken from a Welsh folk song, “Tros y Garreg” (Over the Stone) in Edward Jone’s Welsh Bards, 1794. However, it surface a little later in France: in G. Legeay’s 1875 Ancient Noels, and again in R. Guilmant’s Noels in 1885. In both of these it was the music of a Christmas carol. So it could have originated in either country. The tune is unusual in that it can be played and sung equally well in the major key of G. It was first used in the English Hymnal, 1906.\n\nHugh Davies was born September 1, 1844, in Garth, Denbighshire, and died October 12, 1907, in Swansea, Glamorganshire, on the coast of Wales. Nothing more is known of this musician.",

    "historicalContext": "The tunebook Hesperian Harp, compiled by William Hauser of Wadley, Georgia, in 1848, gives credit for these words to “the Rev. Alex Means, A.M., M.D., D.D., LL.D.,” a Methodist minister of Oxford, Georgia. The 1971 edition of The Sacred Harp says, “The authorship of the words and music of this tune are unknown.” The text given at the head in this case is John 3:16.\n\nResearchers in hymnody call this unusual meter the “Captain Kidd” meter, referring to a ballad about a pirate who was executed in England in 1701. Ellen Jane Lorenz Porter and John F. Garst, writing in the October 1979 The Hymn, tell of finding at least 19 tunes in the eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century American tunebooks that are in this meter and used with sacred hymn texts. They also state that “this ancient pattern of English origin goes back in secular songs to at least 1549 and in sacred ones to a 1567 Scottish collection of ‘ballads changed out of profane songs into godly songs.’”\n\nIt should be pointed out that the beautiful melody of WONDROUS LOVE is a completely different tune, and related to the “Captain Kidd” ballad sonly by the poetic meter. The Dictionary of American Hymnology, First Line Index, lists the first appearance of the text in Stith Mead’s General Selection of the Newest and Most Admired Hymns and Spiritual Songs Now in Use, Lynchburg, Virginia, 1811. (This makes authorship by Alexander Means improbable, since he would have written the hymn at age 10.) The first recorded publication of this text and tune together is in William Walker’s Southern Harmony, the first edition of which was in 1835. However, this tune did not appear until the appendix of the 1843 edition. (See example printed on page 212.) The text and tune fit together so well that later tunebooks, including many of the Baptist hymnals, included this popular favorite.  The arrangement SDAH uses is by Richard Proulx, who since the autumn of 1981 has been minister of music at Holy Name Cathedral, Chicago. Born in Minnesota in 1937, he attended University of Minnesota, McPhail School of Music, and Columbus Boychoir School. His choir of men and boys at Holy Childhood Church, Minneapolis, gained a national reputation for excellence through telecasts, recordings, and concerts with the Minnesota Symphony. Going to Seattle in 1968, he directed three choirs and played the organ at St. Thomas Episcopal Church, at the same time serving as organist at Temple de Hirsch Sinai until 1981. He has more than 100 compositions in print, including works for organ, chorus, instrumental ensembles, and vocal solos. He was one of the editors of the Catholic hymnal Worship II. He makes regular guest appearances as organist, conductor, and choral clinician.",

    "yearWritten": 1707,
    "historicalContext": "Isaac Watts (1674-1748; see Biographies) wrote six stanzas of this hymn in 1707 under the title “Godly sorrow Arising From the Sufferings of Christ.” Through the years, editors have made a number of alterations. The final line of stanza 1 was “For such a worm as I.”\n\nWatts’s membership in the Independent Church gave rise to the mistaken impression that he was a Unitarian. However, he shows his clear belief on this point in the third line of his fourth stanza, which originally was “When God, the mighty Maker, died,” thus identifying Jesus as very God.\n\nThe words of the refrain were added by Ralph Hudson when he wrote the tune for the text. It was first published in Songs of Peace, Love, and Joy, 1885. Until recently it was thought that the refrain was a camp meeting chorus that Hudson borrowed. In the July 1980 issue of The Hymn, Ernest K. Emurian presents evidence of its true source. From the Library of Congress he obtained a copy of a Civil War song entitled “Take Me Home,” ascribed to one “Raymond,” the short form of “Eugene Raymond,” the pen name used by the “Bard of the Confederacy, “John Hill Hewitt (1801-1890).The song was first published as an anonymous poem with music in New York in 1853 by W. L. Bloomfield. Hewitt then composed a Southern edition and published it in Augusta, Georgia, 1864. So it is evident that Hudson adapted what was probably a very popular song and used it with only a couple of note changes for the refrain of this hymn.\n\nRalph E. Hudson was born July 9, 1843, at Napoleon, Ohio, but soon the family moved to Pennsylvania. In 1861 he enlisted in the Army and served as a nurse in the Civil War. Later he taught music at Mount Vernon College, Alliance, Ohio, and became active as singer, composer, and publisher of songbooks. He was licensed to preach in the Methodist Church, and devoted a good portion of his time to evangelistic and temperance work. One of his books was The Temperance Songster. He died at Cleveland, Ohio, June 14,1901.  Fanny Crosby (see Biographies) said her “soul flooded with a celestial light” at the time of her conversion, when this hymn was sung.",

    "historicalContext": "Cecil Frances Alexander, née Humphreys (1818-1895; see SDAH 93), used to drive into Londonderry past a grass-covered hill that reminded her of the hill of Calvary, which was probably a small hillock outside old Jerusalem. She had decided to make the Apostles’ Creed comprehensible to children, so she rewrote each article in simple language and published it in her Hymns for Little Children,1848. With the picture of this hill in mind, perhaps, she simplified and amplified article 4 of the creed, which reads: “Suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried.” However, even in her simple language there was ambiguity, for the second line, which quotes from Hebrews 13:12, “without the gate,” prompted a small child to ask her what was meant by a hill not having a city wall; the child did not understand that without in this case meant “outside,” so she changed it to that. Alexander also wrote SDAH 93, “All Things Bright and Beautiful”; SDAH 149, “Once in Royal David’s City”; and SDAH 285, “Jesus Calls Us.”\n\nHORSLEY is named after the composer. It appeared first in William Horsley’s Twenty-four Psalm Tunes and Eight Chants, 1844, but it first carried this name in the Appendix to Hymns Ancient and Modern, 1868.  William Horsley was born in London on November 15, 1774, and studied music and composition. In 1794 he was appointed organist at Ely Chapel, Holborn; in 1798 he was assistant organist at the Royal Asylum for Female Orphans in Lambeth. From 1802 to 1812 he was organist there, during which time he composed this tune for the girls. He was one of the founders of the London Philharmonic Society and became an intimate friend of Mendelssohn’s. He received a B.Mus. from Oxford in 1800 and died in Kennington, London, June 12, 1858.",

It is based on Revelation 11:15.\n\nSome communions who treat the Second Coming as a sort of poetic drama created by the imagination of John, rather than as a real, coming event, still preserve this hymn and place it under such sections as “The Everlasting Christ,” “His Exaltation,” or “His Abiding Presence.” Certainly the hymn takes on more power and meaning when sung from the heart of those who look for the second coming of Christ as an imminent, historical event, in fulfillment of Christ’s own words, “I will come again” (John 14:1-3).\n\nThomas Kelly was born July 13, 1769, in Dublin, the son of an Irish court judge. Educated at Trinity College, Dublin, to be a lawyer, he later changed to the Anglican ministry and became a most earnest evangelist, preaching “righteousness by faith” in spite of the prohibitions placed upon him by the archbishop. Refused entry into Anglican churches, he preached in unconsecrated buildings and finally left that communion and built a number of his own churches-with his own money. Kelly died in Dublin on May 14, 1855. His other hymns in SDAH are No. 199, “The Head That Once Was Crowned,” and No. 222, “Hark! Ten Thousand Harps and Voices.”  BRYN CALFARIA means “Mount Calvary” in Welsh. It was written for an evangelistic meeting and was first published in Volume II of Owen’s Pearl of Music, 1886, a collection of anthems and hymn tunes. The English Hymnal, 1906, introduced it in churches outside of Wales. The minor-key grandeur of this tune is fully realized in a chorale prelude by Ralph Vaughan Williams, published in his Three Preludes Founded on Welsh Hymn Tunes. The unusual meter seems to be a “Welsh characteristic,” two lines of 8.7.8.7. followed by a 4. that is often repeated, rising to a climax and conclusion in a final line of 7. (see CWM RHONDDA, SDAH 201 and 538). William Owen(1813 or 1814-1893; the family name is “Prysgol” in Welsh) was born at Bangor, Caernarvonshire, Wales, and worked in the slate quarries, as did his father before him. He wrote his first hymn tune at age 18 and went on to compose many anthems and hymns. For most of his life his home was in Caeathro, Wales. He also wrote music to SDAH 180, “O Listen to Our Wondrous Story.” The arrangement is by Melvin West (1930-; see Biographies).",

    "historicalContext": "This triumphant hymn of the Resurrection was written by Charles Wesley (1707-1788; see Biographies), and appeared in his Hymns and Sacred Poems, 1739. His brother, John, set a tune for it in his collection of 1742 but for some reason did not include it in the Wesleyan hymnbook until much later; it appeared in Church of England collections by 1780. There were originally 11 stanzas but no “Alleluias.” The use of this word of praise after each line was an ancient Christian practice, but the medieval church forbade its use between Septuagesima and Easter Day (about 70 days).\n\nSDAH’s third stanza is taken from the first half of Wesley’s second, plus the last half of Wesley’s third.  The tune WORGAN was so named in the mistaken impression that it was composed by a Dr. J. Worgan, who, however, was not born when the melody was printed in John Walsh’s Lyra Davidica, a collection of sacred songs and hymns made by John Walsh (?-1736) in 1708. It is also named EASTER HYMN. Walsh was a music publisher, born in Ireland, who had established himself in London by 1695, publishing, among others, works by George Frederick Handel.",

    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": 1866,
    "historicalContext": "This hymn was written in 1866 by William Chatterton Dix (1837-1898; see SDAH 123), and appeared first in Altar Songs, 1867, in praise of Jesus’ ascension to heaven after the Resurrection. It carried the title “Redemption by the Precious Blood.” The first two lines of each stanza began with a jubilant “Alleluia,” the Latin form of the Hebrew word hallelujah, which means literally “praise ye Jehovah.” Unusual for a hymn about Jesus’ victorious ascension, this one, with the third line of the final stanza, “Intercessor, Friend of sinners, earth’s Redeemer, plead for me,” follows the Savior into His ministry in the heavenly sanctuary. Dix also wrote SDAH 123, “As With Gladness Men of Old,” and SDAH 141, “What Child Is This?”\n\nThe tune name HYFRYDOL means “good cheer” and was written before Rowland Pritchard was 20 years old. Born January 14, 1811, in Graienyn, near Bala in the Cambrian Mountains of north Wales, he was privileged to be raised in an atmosphere of song. His grandfather was the famous bard Rowland Huw.\n\nThe younger Rowland evidently was in poor circumstances, for he spent the final seven years of his life as a loom-tender’s assistant in the Welsh Flannel Manufacturing Company mill at Holywell, Wales. This was some 30 miles northeast of his birthplace, where he had lived most of his life. He died on January 25,1887.\n\nRowland was blessed with a good voice and was much in demand as a soloist and song leader. A number of his hymn tunes appeared in Welsh periodicals, but this one is considered his best. It has gone around the world in the hymnals of nearly all churches, with at least a dozen different texts. In spite of the fact that the range encompasses only five notes (with an extra sixth note in the climax phrase), the tune is strong and a joy to sing.  The arrangement in SDAH is by Melvin West (1930-; see Biographies). HYFRYDOL is used again with alternate harmony for SDAH 204 with “Come, Thou Long Expected Jesus.”",

    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "This two-stanza hymn employs exalted language to tell how the vastness of stellar space received our Lord when He ascended to heaven after the Resurrection. Robbins names two of the best-known constellations, the Pleiades and Orion, and uses the phrase “His footsteps trace thro’ corridors sublime.” in this connection, the following words from Early Writings, by Ellen G. White, page 41,are interesting: “December 16, 1848,the Lord gave me a view of the shaking of the powers of the heavens….The atmosphere parted and rolled back; then we could look up through the open space in Orion, whence came the voice of God. The Holy City will come down through that open space.”\n\nBorn in Philadelphia on December 11, 1876, Howard Robbins received his B.D. degree from Episcopal Theological Seminary in 1903.He served as curate (associate pastor) in Morristown and Englewood, New Jersey. From 1917 to 1929 he was dean of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine and from 1929 to 1941 professor at the General Theological Seminary. He retired in 1941, and died in Washington, D.C., on March 20, 1952. He contributed eight hymn texts to The Hymnal 1940, and one hymn tune, CHELSEA SQUARE.\n\nFOREST GREEN is named after the small English village in Surrey where Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872-1958; see Biographies) heard a variation of the folk melody. He first used it as a hymn tune in The English Hymnal, 1906, and it appears in Oxford Book of Carols, 1928, with “Come, All You Worthy Christian Men.” Benjamin Britten arranged it in one of his song collections with the Irish words “The Star of County Down.” This tune has found a place in most modern hymnals. SDAH uses it again at No.90, “Eternal God, Whose Power Upholds.”",

    "yearWritten": 1859,
    "historicalContext": "John of Damascus (c. 675-c. 749), a monk and choir leader at the monastery of Mar Saba near the Dead Sea, wrote a canon for the Sunday after Easter, St. Thomas’ Day or Low Sunday. The first ode of this canon was based on the deliverance of the people of God at the Red Sea as recorded in the Song of Moses, Exodus 15:13. The ode was written in the middle of the eighth century and translated from the Greek in 1859 by John Mason Neale (1818-1866; see Biographies).\n\nThe third stanza, which is in the nature of a doxology to the Trinity, was added by the compilers of Hymns Ancient and Modern, according to the then current custom.\n\nThe tune was composed especially for these words in 1872 by Arthur Seymour Sullivan. Its name, ST. KEVIN, so designated in the composer’s Hymn Tunes, 1902, commemorates a hermit who established a monastery in\n\nthe Vale of Glendalough, Ireland. The hermit died at the monastery about\n\nA.D. 618, at the reputed age of 120.\n\nSullivan was born at Lambeth, London, on May 13, 1842, his father being an Irish bandmaster and teacher of music. He inherited a talent for music; by the time he was 8 years old he could play every wind instrument in his father’s band. In 1854 he was a chorister at the Chapel Royal; he won a scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music in 1856, taking first place above Joseph Barnby. This enabled him to study music on the continent. He spent more than two years in the conservatorium at Leipzig. His voice had now broken, so he studied piano, theory, composition, orchestration, and conducting. He returned to London in 1861. He was church organist at St. Michael’s, Chester Square, London, and a teacher of music, devoting much of his time to composition. In 1867 he became professor of composition at the Royal Academy, and was appointed musical editor of Church Hymns, composing most of his hymn tunes during the period 1867 to 1874. He was principal, from 1876 to 1882, of the National Training School of Music, which later became the Royal College of Music. For his services to music he received the honorary degree of D.Mus. from Cambridge in 1876 and from Oxford in 1879, and a knighthood from the queen in 1883. He is well remembered for his association with W. S. Gilbert and the light music of the Savoy operas, but he composed excellent oratorios, overtures, anthems, secular songs, and church and choral music. He died in Westminster, London, on November 22, 1900, and was buried in St. Paul’s Cathedral.  His other tunes and an arrangement in SDAH are No. 568, LEOMIN-STER; No. 582, ST. EDMUND; and No. 612, ST. GERTRUDE.",

    "historicalContext": "The original of this hymn, in French, “A toi la gloire” (To Thee the Glory), dated 1884, was first published in the YMCA Hymn Book, Lausanne, Switzerland, 1904. Hoyle’s 1923 translation into English was included in Cantate Domino (the hymnal of the World’s Student Christian Federation), 1925, and was the favorite hymn at the 1948 assembly of the World Council of Churches in Amsterdam.\n\nEdmond Louis Budry was born August 30, 1854, at Vevey, Switzerland, and educated at Lausanne to be a minister of the National Reformed Church. For eight years he was pastor at Cully before going to the Free Church at Vevey, where he ministered for 35 years. During this time he wrote many original hymns and translated others from Latin, German, and English into French. More than 60 of his hymns were used in various French hymnals. He died November 12, 1932.\n\nThe translator, Richard Birch Hoyle, was born March 8, 1875, in Cloughfold, Lancashire, England, into a Methodist home. He was educated at Regent’s Park College, London, and ordained a Baptist minister. For 20 years he served various churches, then edited the YMCA paper Red Triangle for five years. A sojourn of two years, 1934 to 1936, found him teaching systematic theology at Western Theological Seminary, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, after which he returned to a pastorate in Kingston-on-Thames, Surrey. He contributed “The Holy Spirit” to The Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics. He died at Wimbledon, Surrey, on December 14, 1939.\n\nJUDAS MACCABEUS was first composed by Handel (1685–1759; see SDAH 125) for his oratorio Joshua, 1747, but was taken for his Judas Maccabeus in 1751. He wrote this oratorio, based on the life of the great Jewish hero of that name, at the request of Frederick, prince of Wales, who wanted something grand to celebrate the victory of his brother, the duke of Cumberland, at Culloden, Invernessshire, in 1746. The tune was made for “See the Conquering Hero Comes,” and has been adapted for “Thine Is the Glory.” The original French and the English translation were written with this tune in mind.",

He died at Speldhurst, near Tunbridge Wells, Kent, on October 26, 1909.\n\nIn 1591, Palestrina wrote a musical setting of “Gloria Patri et Filio” (Glory to the Father and to the Son), for his Magnificat Tertii Toni. William H. Monk (see SDAH 50) made a free adaptation of the melody, reharmonized it, and added the “alleluias” for inclusion in the first edition of Hymns Ancient and Modern, 1861, of which he was musical editor. The tune name VICTORY comes from Christ’s victory over death and the tomb, as expressed in the text.\n\nGiovanni Pierluigi, now best known by the name of his birthplace, was born about 1525 in Palestrina, near Rome, Italy. At age 19 he was appointed organist-choirmaster in the cathedral there. In 1550 when his bishop became Pope Julius III, Palestrina was taken with him to Rome, where he spent the remainder of his life directing papal choirs and composing more than 90 Masses and more than 200 motets for the church, and madrigals for the Roman society. During the Council of Trent (1545–1563), in the discussions of church music, the polyphonic (many sounds) music of Palestrina was given as the highest example of what the music of the church should be. His works are universally considered to be the finest in the pure, devotional polyphonic style. A full edition of his music was published in 33 volumes by Breitkopf and Hartel, 1862–1903. He wrote music for the Catholic Church in a stately, noble style to counteract the success that his contemporary, Martin Luther, was having in bringing back congregational singing by including the use of popular folk songs. Palestrina died at Rome on February 2, 1594, and was buried in St. Peter’s Cathedral.",

    "historicalContext": "This text was written especially for this tune; they were first printed together in Songs of Praise, 1931, a British hymnbook edited by Percy Dearmer (see SDAH 259) and published by Oxford University Press. Cyril Argentine Alington was headmaster at Eton College at the time he wrote it. Born October 23, 1872, at Ipswich, he followed his father’s footsteps and became an Anglican minister. Educated at Oxford, he held teaching positions at All Souls’, Marlborough College, Eton College, and Shrewsbury School. He returned to Eton as headmaster in 1917, staying from 1921 until his death in 1955 was chaplain to the king. Publications from his pen include a number of hymns, poetry, essays, and theological works.\n\nThe carol-like qualities of this Resurrection hymn are reinforced by phrases such as “Bring flowers of song to strew His way,” and, of course, the triple “Alleluia” ending. The original hymn began “Good Christian Men…” but the word friendshas been substituted to include everyone. Alington also wrote “You That Know the Lord Is Gracious,” SDAH 583.\n\nGELOBT SEI GOTT (God Be Praised) adds to the joy of singing by the simple scalewise passages, syncopation in the second line, and the three “Alleluias” coming down the scale to the finish. It was first set with the German text “Gelobt Sei Gott” in Melchior Vulpius’ book Ein schön geistlich Gesangbuch (Sacred Songbook), 1609. The tune is also called VULPIUS.\n\nVulpius’ birthdate is usually given as c. 1560 and 1570. Born at Wasungen, Thuringia, Germany, he was obviously quite talented at both composing and arranging singable melodies. He may have arranged this exuberant one from a folk song. Two important collections that he edited and published were the one mentioned above, and Cantiones Sacrae, 1602. For 13 years he was cantor at Weimar, where he died August 7, 1615. His name is probably a latinized version of the German name “Wolf.” For another of his tunes see SDAH 629, VULPIUS.",

    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "Originally 33 stanzas long, this hymn was written in 1739 while Zinzendorf was returning to Saxony from a missionary journey to St. Thomas, West Indies. Published that same year in the eighth appendix to his Gesangbuch Herrnhut(Herrnhut Hymnbook), it came to the attention of John Wesley. Wesley’s translation into English preserved 24 of the stanzas, first printed in his Hymns and Sacred Poems, 1740. His title was “The Believer’s Triumph”; SDAH uses Wesley’s stanza 1, lines 1 and 3 of stanza 2, lines 1 and 2 of stanza 7, and stanza 12.\n\nCount Nicholaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf was born May 26, 1700, in Dresden, Germany, to a wealthy family of nobility who were determined that he would be a nobleman, involved in politics. Educated in Pietism (personal devotional religion) by his grandmother and at the University of Halle, he set his heart on becoming a preacher. Dutifully he studied law at the University of Wittenberg, then at age 19 he traveled all over Europe, observing different kinds of religion. He came to the conclusion that the best of all was a personal religion, or, as he called it, “Christianity of the heart.” In Düsseldorf he was deeply impressed by a picture of the thorn-crowned Christ that bore underneath the words “What hast thou done for Me?” Returning home, Zinzendorf accepted the position of councilor of state at the court of Saxony. He held prayer meetings at his large house and wrote hymns especially for these occasions.\n\nIn 1722 he met a carpenter of the Moravian Brethren, who because of persecution in Bohemia had fled to Saxony for religious freedom. Sympathetic with the suffering of these persecuted Christians, Zinzendorf gave them refuge on his beautiful estate and helped them build a village named “Herrnhut”—the “Lord’s Shelter.” In 10 years their number grew to 600, and Zinzendorf enthusiastically joined in their activities of organizing, printing tracts and hymnbooks, and engaging in missionary work. In 1734 he decided to become a minister; he received a license to preach from the theological faculty at the University of Tübingen, and was consecrated as a bishop of the Moravian Brethren in 1737.\n\nOpposed by the Lutherans, Zinzendorf was banned by an edict of 1737 on charges of preaching false doctrine. He used this setback as an opportunity, and traveled widely, preaching and establishing Moravian colonies in Germany, Holland, England, and America. He arrived in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, on Christmas Day, 1741. He founded the colony that is still there, which has a strong and famous musical tradition. When the ban was lifted, in 1747 he was able to return to his estate, and continued to direct the affairs of the Moravian Brethren. All his wealth was devoted to religious work, and he died a poor man at Herrnhut on May 9, 1760.\n\nWith Zinzendorf (who wished not to be called Count but a “plain, Lutheran preacher”), writing hymns was a passion. He wrote the first of some 2,000 at age 12, and the last one came from his pen just a few days before his death. The many hymnbooks he edited and published were taken by devout Moravian missionaries all over the world; their influence on later hymnody has been significant.\n\nJohn Benjamin Wesley, born June 17, 1703, at Epworth rectory, Lincolnshire, England, was educated at Oxford University; he earned the B.A. in 1724 and an M.A. in 1727. After becoming a fellow of Lincoln College, he went back to Epworth and assisted in his father’s parish. In 1729 he accepted a teaching position at Oxford, where, with his brother Charles Wesley (see Biographies), he became the leader of the Holy Club, also known as Oxford Methodists because of their disciplined approach to Bible study and devotional life. Under sponsorship of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, John and Charles went as missionaries to Savannah, Georgia. On the ship they met a group of Moravian missionaries and were deeply impressed with their piety and fervor. After returning to London, John started a church in an old foundry building, the beginning of the Methodist Church.\n\nLearning the power of hymn singing from the Moravians, Wesley studied German in order to translate and use their hymns in English. (While at Savannah, in 1737 he printed Collection of Psalms and Hymns, the first hymnal ever used in an Anglican church.) It was under his editing, organizing, and publishing the hymns of his brother, Charles, that hymnody became the most powerful evangelizing influence England ever knew.\n\nA most amazing man, John Wesley traveled more than a quarter of a million miles, mostly on horseback; preached some 40,000 sermons; and was ordained by the Anglicans, he could not preach in their churches, for he had a burden to preach the gospel to the poor, the drunken, and the outcasts of society, whose presence was not welcomed in the Anglican churches. Taking as his motto “The world is my parish,” he became an itinerant preacher. Although not wishing to break with the Church of England, he was forced to organize his followers and ultimately to ordain those capable to be Methodist preachers. He wrote a few original hymns, but his work in this field is best known by some 30 translations he made from French, Spanish, and German. His other hymn in SDAH is No. 519, “Give to the Winds Your Fears.” He died in London on March 2, 1791.\n\nWilliam Gardiner, born March 15, 1769, in Leicester, England, worked in his father’s business, manufacturing stockings. But his hobby of music took most of his interest. On trips to Germany he met Haydn, Beethoven, and Mozart. It is said that at one meeting he gave Haydn a pair of stockings from his own plant, into which the opening bars of the tune AUSTRIA (see SDAH 423) were woven! His book in three volumes, Music and Friends, 1838–1853, is an account of all these adventures. He was the first to introduce the music of Beethoven into England. From 1812 to 1838 he published two editions of Sacred Melodies, with tunes adapted from the great composers and put to the finest of the sacred poems. It was his hope to replace both the old and new versions of the psalms then in use in the church. These six volumes became a prime source for later hymnal editors and compilers, among them the notable Lowell Mason (see Biographies). He died at age 84 in Leicester on November 16, 1853.\n\nGARDINER, also known as GERMANY, FULDA, WALTON, BEETHOVEN, and MELCHIZEDEC, was credited to a Beethoven “subject.” In The Hymnal 1940 Companion Leonard Ellinwood has pointed out that the Allegretto ma non troppo movement of Beethoven’s Piano Trio, Opus 70, No. 2 (1809), “bears marked resemblance to the beginning and end of Gardiner’s tune.” SDAH uses this tune two more times, for Nos. 355 and 376. Another tune from Gardiner’s Sacred Melodies is LYONS for “O Worship the King,” SDAH 83, which Routley says Gardiner adapted from a tune in one of Michael Haydn’s masses. He also arranged CREATION (SDAH 96).",

While we were traversing this valley of sorrow, the song was born.”\n\nThe hymn is based on Mark 15:37, 38, and a similar passage in Matthew 27:50, 51. When an unseen hand tore in two the veil separating the Most Holy Place from the holy in the Jewish Temple, it signified that the way was forever opened to all who would enter into the presence of God through the merits of the shed blood of Christ. First published by the Nazarenes, the hymn became a favorite of many denominations.\n\nN. B. Herrell (1879–1954) was born in Miami, Indiana, and served as pastor, evangelist, and district superintendent for many years. Among the churches he pastored was the Nazarene church at Arlington, Virginia.",

    "historicalContext": "Roswell Fenner Cottrell (1814–1892) wrote these words in 1886 when he was a minister of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The poem was first published that same year in Hymns and Tunes. He was born into a Seventh-day Baptist family, descended from the Huguenots, in the state of New York. Prior to 1844 he was much interested in the teachings of William Miller concerning the second advent of Jesus, but he realized that the Millerites were not observing the true Sabbath, the seventh day of the week. About 1851, through reading the Adventist paper Review and Herald, Cottrell joined the Adventists and became a regular contributor as writer and poet; he also prepared Sabbath school lessons every week for the children. In 1855, when the publishing house moved to Battle Creek, Michigan, he served on the editorial committee.\n\nA forceful writer and powerful preacher, Cottrell was a pioneer in tent evangelism, working with J. N. Loughborough and W. S. Ingraham in New York and Pennsylvania.\n\nThis hymn, first appearing in Hymns and Tunes, 1886, describes the great love of God for many shown in sending His Son to die for us. Now He pleads on our behalf, for He knows our weaknesses and will not be satisfied until He restores us. Cottrell also wrote SDAH 417, “O Solemn Thought.”\n\nIn the Church Hymnal, 1941, this text was set to WOODLAND by Nathaniel D. Gould, but was seldom used. With a number of other wanted texts, the SDAH Committee sent it to Adventist composers, asking for original tunes. From several submitted, LA SIERRA by Perry Beach, was chosen.\n\nBorn October 24, 1917, at Lincoln, Nebraska, Beach earned the B.S. in music education at University of Nebraska in 1939. At Eastman School of Music, University of Rochester, New York, studying with Wilbur Chenoweth, Howard Hanson, and Bernard Rogers, he received the M.A. in music composition in 1940, and a Ph.D. in 1953. After teaching two years at Union College, Lincoln, Nebraska, he spent three years in the Army during World War II, 10 months of which were in France. The rest of his career has been as professor of music, at Andrews University, Berrien Springs, Michigan (1946–1957), and at La Sierra College, Loma Linda University, Riverside, California (1957 to the present). He has continued his teaching and writing since retirement in 1982.\n\nAt age 17 he won the prize for composing a class song at Lincoln High School, and in 1959, the words and music of his hymn “To Make Man Whole” were chosen as the official hymn for Loma Linda University. Publications include Rondo Capriccioso, a two-piano arrangement of the Mendelssohn work; Christmas Spiritual, Rejoice in the Lord, double chorus and brass; and Come Unto Me. His cantata Then Said Isaiah was performed and recorded on Crystal Records by the Vincent Mitzeffelt Camerata of Los Angeles. After the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Beach wrote Ode to a Fallen President, which was sung and recorded by the La Sierra College student body in a chapel service. From his prolific and versatile pen have come works for choir, orchestra, male chorus, piano, brass, and solo songs in many styles. In 1980 he began a collection of the compositions of Seventh-day Adventists worldwide, making them available for performance and research. The collection is now at the La Sierra College Library. In 1986 he wrote, on commission, a symphony that was first performed by the Redlands Symphony Orchestra in March of 1987.\n\nThe tune name LA SIERRA comes from the college where Beach has taught theory and composition since 1957, and the community where he lives with his wife, Marilyn, and enjoys hobbies of rose growing, amateur radio, and color photography.",

    "historicalContext": "This is one of only four hymns SDAH has on the priesthood of Christ. The refrain, with its unusual antiphonal phrases between the treble and bass clefs, is based on Hebrews 7:24, 25.\n\nThe first publication of the hymn was in Hymns for His Praise, 1903. It was copied, for example, for some 125 hymnals up to the year 1966 included.\n\nJames Martin Gray was born May 11, 1851, in New York, New York, and became a rector in the Reformed Episcopal Church and a lecturer in his denomination’s seminary in Philadelphia. In 1893 he went, at D. L. Moody’s invitation, to teach Bible at the Bible Institute for Home and Foreign Missions (later called Moody Bible Institute). After Moody’s death Gray became president in 1925 and stayed there until retirement in 1934. He died at Chicago, September 21, 1935. Gray authored a number of books; he also guided in the publication of the Voice of Thanksgiving, Nos. 1 to 4, 1913–1928, the official hymnals for the institute. Another of his gospel songs that was well known in his era was “Nor Silver Nor Gold,” which F. E. Belden (see Biographies) printed in his best-selling Christ in Song, 1908.\n\nFor comments on William Owen (1814–1893) and another of his tunes, see SDAH 165, BRYN CALFARIA.\n\nThe durable quality of this hymn is seen in the fact that it appeared on the program and was sung at the “Gymanfa Ganu” (Welsh Hymn Sing) Sunday, April 14, 1985, at the Presbyterian St. Andrew’s Church, Toronto, Canada.",

    "author": "Frank E. Graeff",

    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "First Peter 5:7, “Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you,” was the comforting text that inspired this poem. Frank Graeff had been in a time of physical trouble, doubt, and depression, and the stanzas reflect a questioning attitude about whether Jesus is far away or close by when we are in trouble. The refrain gives the resounding answer, “O yes, He cares,” echoing the words of Scripture. Graeff said, “The hymn seems to carry comfort and hope to troubled hearts, and I am glad I had the inspiration to write it.”\n\nBorn December 19, 1860, in Tamaqua, Pennsylvania, Graeff was educated in this “Pennsylvania Dutch” territory. He became a Methodist minister and served as a pastor of many different churches. Because of his ability as a storyteller and writer, with a special emphasis on ministry to children, he gained a reputation as “The Sunshine Minister.” He wrote a successful book, The Minister’s Twins, and authored more than 200 hymns and songs. He died at Ocean Grove, New Jersey, on July 29, 1919. C. Austin Miles, who wrote “In the Garden” (see SDAH 487), said this about Graeff: “He is a spiritual optimist, a great friend of children; his bright sunshiny disposition attracts him not only to children but to all with whom he comes in contact. He has a holy magnetism and a childlike faith.”\n\nThe composer of the music, Joseph Lincoln Hall, inherited a talent for music from his parents, who were recognized musicians in Philadelphia, where he was born November 4, 1866. At 19 he was appointed director of achoir of 100 members, and held that post for 10 years. Studying harmony, counterpoint, fugue, and orchestration at the University of Pennsylvania, he graduated with high honors. Later he was honored with a D.Mus. degree from Harriman University.\n\nWhile he lived, his greatest source of fame was as a director of large choirs, including camp meetings in Pennsylvania and Ohio. He led the chorus at Pitman Grove and at Gainesville Bible Conference in Florida. The 1910 summer season at Ocean Grove, New Jersey, found him leading the singing there. He composed music in many different forms, including oratorios, cantatas, anthems, hymns, and gospel songs. It is said that he possessed a beautiful tenor voice, and was an accomplished organist. He was associated with Hall-Mack Company, a music publisher that later merged with the Rodeheaver Company of Winona Lake, Indiana (now a part of Word, Inc.). “Does Jesus Care?” was written about 1901, but was not published until 1905, when it appeared in New Songs of the Gospel. Hall wrote hundreds of gospel songs, but said that this one was his “most inspired piece of music.” He died at Philadelphia on November 29, 1930.",

    "historicalContext": "In 1965 Brian Wren (1936– ) went as pastor to a Congregational church in Essex, England. Writing in The Hymn, January 1981, he says: “In 1968 on Easter Sunday we sang a hymn called “Christ Is Alive,” which I wrote within 10 days because about 10 days before, Martin Luther King was assassinated. It seemed impossible to celebrate Easter without taking that into our thinking. I wrote the hymn after that particular event but also hoping it would say something more universal. So that we would not be singing to an unfamiliar tune, I wrote it for the tune TRURO.” The hymn with this tune is published in his book Faith Looking Forward, where he further explains, “The final stanza was rewritten in 1978 to remove the masculine metaphors in the original (‘he rules... to every man displayed’ becomes ‘shall be to all on earth displayed’), but more particularly to catch the dynamism of the Holy Spirit.”\n\nWren wrote the hymn specifically to fit a tune that was well known to his people. It should be familiar in SDA churches, also, since it was in the 1941 Church Hymnal. However, it was one of those easy-to-neglect half-page hymns and was not often sung. The tune is strong and singable. It will be found again in SDAH 378 with the text “Go, Preach My Gospel.”\n\nTRURO first appeared in Thomas Williams’ Psalmodia Evangelica; A Complete Set of Psalms and Hymns in Three Parts for Public Worship, Part II, 1789. It was used here with Watts’s text “Now to the Lord a Noble Song,” but has been more often sung to his “Jesus Shall Reign Where’er the Sun,” SDAH 227. We have no information about the composer of this tune, which gets its name from an old town in Cornwall, England.\n\nThomas John Williams was born in Ynysmeudwy, a small village in Glamorgan, south Wales, in 1869. He studied music in Cardiff and was the organist and choirmaster of the Zion Church, Llanelly, in Carmarthenshire from 1903 to 1913. Later on he transferred to Calfaria Church in the same town. He composed several hymn tunes and some anthems. He died in Llanelly on April 24, 1944.",

This verse and Ephesians 1:7, “In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace,” constitute the heading of the hymn in Hymns and Tunes, 1886.\n\nIn Hymns and Tunes, and also in Christ in Song, the last line of the last stanza has the words my love printed in italics to emphasize the contrast with God’s “such love” in line 2.\n\nThe tune, unnamed, is also by Franklin Belden. It is a typical gospel song with a pleasant melody, but the harmony is based almost exclusively on two chords, with a few passing notes.",

    "historicalContext": "Elvina Mabel Hall was a member of the choir of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Baltimore. While she was sitting in the choir during a rather long prayer, in the spring of 1865, she jotted down the words of this hymn on the flyleaf of a hymnbook, the New Lute of Zion. After the service she passed them to the minister, the Reverend Shrick, who kept them until he could find a suitable tune. The title of the hymn was “All to Christ I Owe.” There was one more stanza:\n\nThis was omitted from SDAH because of its teaching on the immediate flight of the soul to heaven after death.\n\nHall was born on June 4, 1820, in Alexandria, Virginia; she moved to Baltimore, where she was a member of the Monument Street Methodist Church for more than 40 years. Following the death of her husband, she married the Reverend Thomas Myers in 1885. She died on July 18, 1889, at Ocean Grove, New Jersey.\n\nThe tune, sometimes called ALL TO CHRIST, was composed by John Thomas Grape, the organist of the same church in Baltimore. He took care of the cabinet organ at home while the church was undergoing alterations, and thus had the opportunity to play and compose in his spare time. He was trying to find a melody for William Batchelder Bradbury’s words “Jesus Paid It All.” His wife considered his effort a good one, but his friends and the choir members thought it rather commonplace. However, the Reverend Shrick coupled Hall’s words with Grape’s tune, and it was well received as a gospel song. It was published in Sabbath Chords in 1868.\n\nGrape was born on May 6, 1835, in Baltimore. He was a coal merchant who was interested in music as a hobby. He directed the choir of the Monument Street Methodist Church and wrote other hymn tunes. He died in Baltimore on November 2, 1915.",

    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "This hymn, with this tune, was first published by W. L. Thompson in his Century Hymnal, 1904. It concerns living life as a friend of Jesus.\n\nWill Lamartine Thompson was born November 7, 1847, at East Liverpool, Ohio; he studied at Mount Union College, Ohio; Boston Conservatory of Music; and later at Leipzig, Germany. Back in his hometown, he formed Will L. Thompson and Company, and had a successful career writing and publishing sacred and secular songs in many collections. He was known as “The Bard of Ohio.” As a boy in a musical family, he quickly learned to play piano, organ, and other musical instruments. At 16 he was already composing secular songs that were good enough to be published. At age 27 he took four of his songs to a well-known publisher in Cleveland and offered all of them for $100. The publisher said they were worth, at the most, only $25. So Thompson went to New York and had them printed; he managed the sales himself. They all had a good sale, but two of them became immensely popular. Within a year he had earned more than $1,000 from these songs. This encouraged him to start his own business.\n\nMany of his songs were written as the result of a sudden inspiration, so he always carried a notebook wherever he went, and would jot down ideas for text and music. When asked, “How do you get the music in your mind without going to the instrument?” he replied, “The music comes to my mind the same as any other thought. As I write the words of a song, a fitting melody is already in my mind; and as I jot down the music, I know just how it will sound. I write the different parts of the harmony, and the whole piece is rehearsed in my mind.”\n\nAmong his many sacred songs that became widely used are: “There’s a Great Day Coming”; “The Sinner and the Song”; “Lead Me Gently Home, Father”; and “Softly and Tenderly” (see SDAH 287). He died in New York City September 20, 1909.\n\nThe tune is named ELIZABETH in honor of his wife, Elizabeth Johnson, whom he married in 1891 at East Liverpool, Ohio. He made this state and river famous by his secular song, “My Home on the Old Ohio.” The tune ELIZABETH is in the unusual meter of 8.6.8.6.8.8.4.4.3.",

    "authorBirthDeath": "1859–1918",
    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": 1910,
    "historicalContext": "Written in 1910, this hymn borrows several phrases from Charles Wesley’s “Jesus, Lover of My Soul” (SDAH 490). Notice also how it uses a number of the names of Christ to describe His complete ministry in our lives. It was published first with the Welsh tune HYFRYDOL (see SDAH 167, 204) in Alexander’s Gospel Songs, No. 2, published by Revell.\n\nJ. Wilbur Chapman was born June 17, 1859, at Richmond, Indiana, and educated at Lane Theological Seminary. After ordination to the Presbyterian ministry, he served for 20 years as a pastor in Albany, New York; Philadelphia; and New York City. A visit from the great evangelist D. L. Moody roused and inspired him, and from then on his life was completely filled with evangelism. In 1902 he was appointed secretary of an aggressive Evangelistic Committee for the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church. The work of large-city campaigns was so successful that soon he had to cease administrative work to answer calls from all over the world to conduct preaching missions.\n\nMoody had also showed him how to use the power of singing in his meetings, so he secured the services of singing evangelist Charles Alexander, who was a veritable “magician” in leading huge choirs and crowds in services of song. Chapman and Alexander worked so well as a team that they traveled the world, preaching and singing for 10 years. (On page 233 is a picture of a businessmen’s noon meeting in Melbourne, Australia, Town Hall, May, 1909.) Alexander described his partner’s skill in “handling” a big crowd: “The musical quality of his voice stirred and yet quieted an audience. His words, clearly enunciated, could be heard without strain by an immense crowd (often 10,000), even when hushed to a quiet whisper” (from Charles Alexander, H. C. Alexander and J. K. MacClean, 1920). In these present days of dependence on microphones and amplifiers, this feat seems almost impossible! Chapman died December 25, 1918, at Jamaica, New York.\n\nThe tune named HOLY MANNA comes from the use of that phrase several times in the text usually associated with this music, “Brethren, We Have Met to Worship.” The tune was first printed, and composeship claimed, by William Moore in his collection Columbian Harmony, 1827. The book was registered in Wilson County, Tennessee, and printed in Cincinnati; Moore claimed to be the composer of 18 of its tunes. About his life, nothing more has been found. This joyful tune became so popular that many of the compilers of later shaped-note, oblong tunebooks in the South included it.\n(See page 234 for a reprint from the 1853 Timbrel of Zion, which shows this hymn with the original text crediting Moore as the composer.)\n\nThe arrangement is by Wayne Hooper (1920–; see Biographies).",

    "title": "My Song Is Love Unknown",
    "author": "Samuel Crossman",
    "authorBirthDeath": "1624–1683",
    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "Although Isaac Watts is known as the “Father of English Hymnody,” there were several seventeenth-century poets before him who wrote “hymns of human composure,” as opposed to the officially sanctioned metrical versions of the psalms. Crossman shares this distinction with George Herbert (SDAH 9) and Thomas Ken (SDAH 1), among others. This hymn, characterized by some as one of the finest in the English language on the subject of our Lord’s loving sacrifice for us, appeared as one of nine in Crossman’s The Young Man’s Meditation, or Some Few Sacred Poems Upon Selected Subjects, and Scriptures, 1664. Although they were in the psalm meters, they were probably meant to be read rather than sung, as evidenced by this motto printed with them: “A Verse may find him whom a Sermon flies.”\n\nBorn about 1624 at Bradfield Monachorum, Suffolk, England, Samuel Crossman was educated at Pembroke College, Cambridge. At his first church assignment, All Saints, Sudbury, he also was sympathetic with and ministered to a Puritan congregation. Puritans were known as “dissenters” from the established Anglican Church. As an attempt to bring peace in this controversy, the Savoy Conference of 1661 was called to revise the Book of Common Prayer to make it acceptable to both groups. When they were not able to come up with a compromise, the 1662 Act of Uniformity resulted in some 2,000 ministers losing their churches. Crossman was among them, but he later conformed and became a chaplain to the king in 1665. Two years later he was appointed to Bristol Cathedral, and just a few months before his death on February 4, 1684, was made its dean.\n\nLOVE UNKNOWN gets its name from the text, and was composed for these words at the request of Geoffrey Shaw while Shaw was working on Songs of Praise, 1926. As an experiment, the editors of that book invited composers who were not primarily church musicians to submit original hymn tunes. In a letter to the London Daily Telegraph, April 5, 1950, a Donald Ford stated that Ireland composed the music in a quarter of an hour on a scrap of paper immediately after receiving Shaw’s request. Shaw and Ireland were having lunch. About halfway through their meal, Shaw handed his guest a slip of paper with verses on it and said, “I want a tune for this lovely poem by Samuel Crossman.” The composer took the paper, read the verses through several times, took out a pencil, and picked up the menu. After writing on the back of the menu for a few minutes, he handed it to Shaw with the casual remark, “Here is your tune.”\n\nLOVE UNKNOWN was not quite what churchgoers and organists of 1926 expected of a new hymn tune, with its alternating six- and four-beat bars, and the unexpected chromatic note halfway through, which brands it as Ireland’s handiwork.\n\nJohn Nicholson Ireland was born August 13, 1879, at Bowdon, Cheshire, England. He was educated at Leeds Grammar School and the Royal School of Music, studying under Stanford (see SDAH 32). For a time he was organist at St. Luke’s Chelsea, but for the most part his creative effort was channeled into composition. His works include “Piano Concerto in E-flat”; “These Things Shall Be,” for chorus and orchestra; “A London Overture”; and many solo songs. In 1932 Durham Cathedral bestowed on him an honorary D.Mus. He died at Washington, Sussex, on June 12, 1962.",

    "historicalContext": "Titled “The Love of Jesus,” this poem was included in a novel, Say and Seal, 1859, written by Anna Warner and her sister Susan (who wrote another children’s song, “Jesus Bids Us Shine”). One of the characters in the book was a motherless boy named Johnny Fax. After the book attained fame, Warner wrote: “For the time being, Johnny Fax was so intensely real, so vividly in my heart, that the hymn was written for him, as if he had been a living child.” There have been a number of alterations and rewrites published in different hymnbooks.\n\nAnna Bartlett Warner was born in 1820 on Long Island, New York, the daughter of a New York lawyer. When she was 17, she and her family moved to Constitution Island, near West Point. She wrote several novels under the name “Amy Lothrop,” and two books of verse, Hymns of the Church Militant, 1858, and Wayfaring Hymns, Original and Translated, 1869. For many years Anna and her older sister Susan held Sunday school classes for the cadets at West Point Military Academy. Their home, named Good Crag, was willed to the academy and is now a national shrine. Anna died in 1915 at age 95; the army gave her a funeral as though she had been one of the soldiers.\n\nShe also wrote SDAH 494, “We Would See Jesus.”\n\nBRADBURY, also known as CHINA and JESUS LOVES ME, was first put with these words in The Golden Shower, 1862, published by William Bradbury (1816–1868; see Biographies); it sold an astonishing 2 million copies! The text and tune have been inseparable ever since. The harmonization in SDAH is by the committee that prepared the Australian Hymn Book, 1977. Carried to nearly all the countries of the world by missionaries, this song has become the most loved and sung of any children’s hymn. W. Hines Sims, editor of the Baptist Hymnal, 1956, says that while visiting a Buddhist temple in Hawaii in 1954, he heard the children singing, “Yes, Buddha loves me, Yes, Buddha loves me”!",

    "yearWritten": 1747,
    "historicalContext": "Charles Wesley (1707–1788; see Biographies) wrote this hymn of four stanzas in 1747 under the title “Jesus, Show Thy Salvation”; it was first printed in that same year in Hymns for Those That Seek, and Those That Have Redemption. At that time there was a popular tune set by Purcell to the “Song of Venus” in Dryden’s play King Arthur. The opening words were:\n\nFairest isle, all isles excelling,\nSeat of pleasures and of loves,\nVenus here will choose her dwelling\nAnd forsake her Cyrian groves.\n\nWesley capitalized on the tune and wrote his hymn in the same meter, using also two of Dryden’s rhymes, but the hymn is virtually a composite of many verses of Scripture, showing Wesley’s familiarity with the Bible.\n\nThe tune BEECHER was composed especially for these words by John Zundel in 1870 and first appeared in Christian Heart Songs. Born December 10, 1815, at Hockdorf, Germany, Zundel migrated to the United States, where he spent more than 30 years. He was the organist for 28 years in the Plymouth Congregational Church in Brooklyn, New York, at a time when the famous preacher Henry Ward Beecher (1813–1887) was the pastor; the tune was named to commemorate him. Zundel was the assistant musical editor for the Plymouth Collection, prepared for the use of Beecher’s congregation, and contributed this tune BEECHER and 27 others to that hymnal. He died in July 1882, at Cannstatt, Germany.",

    "historicalContext": "Both words and music of this hymn were written by Herbert Work, a teacher and concert artist on the saxophone. His wife, Anice, wrote: “Herbert wrote ‘O Shepherd Divine’ while sitting on a large rock in the woods behind St. Helena, California. He always felt he had a marvelous Shepherd to write about. He wanted something a bit more quiet to start the band rehearsal each Tuesday night, and also wanted all who heard it to know what a good Shepherd the band had.” This meditative poem is based on John 10:1–30; verse 16 is echoed in the final stanza, “One staff and one rod, one fold and one God.”\n\nHerbert Archie Work was born June 27, 1904, near Santa Rosa, California. He and his brother attended Lewis School, taught by their mother, and before her, their grandfather Moore. This was a farm family, and Herbert very early learned the value of the “hard work” ethic. He was on the baseball team at Santa Rosa High School and excelled at other sports, but music was his first love. At age 16 he began to make his own living, playing the saxophone and clarinet and making instrumental arrangements that were used on the stage, in concerts, and on the radio by soloists, a symphony orchestra, and dance bands.\n\nWork took four trips as a musician on board ships, once to Australia via Samoa. While playing with a small orchestra on the S.S. Santa Paula (San Francisco, Panama Canal, Philadelphia) in 1932, he read The Marked Bible and The Bible Made Plain. When he disembarked at Philadelphia, he searched out and found the Seventh-day Adventist conference office. He asked the girl at the desk, “Are you a Seventh-day Adventist?” and she answered, “Yes.”\n\nHe said, “Well, I have 32 questions to ask you, and if you answer them to my satisfaction I’ll join your church.”\n\nFlustered, she said, “Oh, if you’ll wait 15 minutes, my dad will be back.”\n\nBut Work asked, “You are an Adventist, aren’t you?”\n\n“Well, yes, I am,” she said.\n\n“Then you can answer what I want to know,” he returned. Seventeen-year-old Dorothy Vandeman (later Lemon) answered all the questions to his satisfaction. Work left his secular profession and was baptized into the Seventh-day Adventist Church in June 1933.\n\nWork studied for a time at Pacific Union College, St. Helena, California, under Noah Paulin. His long and much-appreciated career included 10 years leading a band at the St. Helena Hospital, and teaching band and choral music at Gem State Academy, Caldwell, Idaho; at Southwestern College, Keene, Texas; and at Modesto Academy, Modesto, California. His concert work on the saxophone led to the production of a recording on the Chapel label; one side held sacred music and the other side secular. At one concert he gave in Glendale, California, scouts were present from a university, looking for talent to travel the U.S. and Canada. They made him a very attractive offer. He loved that kind of work, but he chose to accept a call to teach the young people at Modesto Academy.\n\nIn 1954 he published a booklet, Sanctuary Songs, containing 16 items. For his largest work, the cantata Abel, he collaborated with the eldest granddaughter of Ellen G. White, Ella Robinson, who wrote the lyrics, based on Scripture. While at Modesto he composed original background music for the nature pictures of Ernest Booth. In later life, though plagued with emphysema and bronchial asthma, he was still active in helping with the music at the academy near Phoenix, Arizona, and with self-supporting work in Bouse, Arizona; Laurelbrook Academy, Dayton, Tennessee; and Wildwood Institute in Georgia. His fruitful life came to an end back at his beloved St. Helena on December 8, 1982.\n\nHis wife, Anice, shares these thoughts about Herbert Work: “Herbert never sat—he was either writing missionary letters or music! Mostly he had his music in his head and just wrote it down, quicker than I can write this—in the car, doctor’s office, bus depots, anywhere and everywhere. Then he’d take it to the piano and correct it. He never thought his talent anything special. He was the most humble man I’ll ever know. After his conversion, he always played as to the Lord. How he loved Him! I’m waiting impatiently for the Lord to come!”",

    "author": "Jane Eliza Leeson",
    "authorBirthDeath": "1807–1882",
    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "Originally this hymn had four stanzas of eight lines each, of which SDAH has the first, first half of the second, second half of the third, and first half of the fourth, but in a different order.\n\nAs is customary in all Jane Leeson’s poems, she ends with a quotation from Scripture to balance one quoted at the beginning. It should be noted that stanza 1, line 2, should read: “Love’s sweet lesson—‘to obey,’” which gives a deeper meaning, namely that the lesson is one of obedience, which manifests love.\n\nJane Eliza Leeson was born in 1807 or 1808 and lived most of her life in London, where she was active in the work of the Catholic Apostolic Church at Gordon Square. Some of her hymns were improvised during services at the church. The Handbook to The Church Hymnary, 1927, records this witness from a member of the church who witnessed one of these instant words creations: “I have not known anyone with a similar gift. … She only exercised her gift at long intervals, and could choose her own time and her own subject.” Her hymns have been much appreciated and used, especially SDAH 549, “Loving Shepherd of Thy Sheep.” “Savior, Teach Me” first appeared in her Hymns and Scenes of Childhood, 1842. A number of other books of hymns for children came from her pen. She died November 18, 1881, at Leamington, Warwickshire, England.\n\nThe composer of the unnamed tune, A. L. (“Pete”) Butler, was born June 29, 1933, at Noble, Oklahoma. He was educated at Oklahoma Baptist University (B. Mus.) and Southern Baptist Theological Seminary (M. Mus.). During his student days, he held church music positions in Oklahoma and Kentucky. In 1960 he began a long period of service on the staff of First Baptist Church, Ada, Oklahoma. Other positions he held in that state are president of the Baptist Musicians and a member of the board of directors of the Baptist General Convention. He composed a number of hymn tunes, anthems, and a cantata, Something Wonderful.\n\n“Savior, Teach Me Day by Day” was originally written by Butler as a two-part anthem and published in 1969 by Fine Arts Music Press, Tulsa, Oklahoma. Wayne Hooper (1920– ), while directing the music for the Voice of Prophecy radio broadcast, used it as a solo. He also made an arrangement for the King’s Heralds Quartet with orchestral accompaniment, which was a part of their 1976 recording on Chapel Records titled Love. Hooper condensed the original anthem especially for SDAH.\n\nButler also wrote the tune ADA for SDAH 338, “Redeemed.”",

    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "This is one of the most famous hymns written by Frederik Herman Kaan (1929–; see Biographies), contemporary Congregational minister of England. He wrote it as a negative reaction to Felix Adler’s hymn written in 1904, “Sing We of the Golden City.” Kaan felt that while we should not ignore the glorious promise of the heavenly city of the future, we should direct our attention also to the modern earthly cities and their multiple problems. The hymn dwells on a favorite theme of his, “The Humanity of Christ.” Not only was He human, but He chooses to make His presence felt among us in the lives we live, here and now. Not only was He an historical Jesus, but a Savior who cares about us in the present tense. What this hymn is all about might be summed up in the final phrase, “People matter people count!”\n\nThis intensely personal touch is inherent in the gospel. Jesus said that “the very hairs of your head are all numbered. … Ye are of more value than many sparrows” (Luke 12:7). He also related the parable of the one lost sheep in the flock of 100, the one lost coin from the 10 pieces of silver (Luke 15:4, 8).\n\nThe tune is named for Geneva, New York, where George Henry Day was organist and choirmaster at Trinity Church for 31 years. Born September 13, 1883, in New York City, Day studied with E. S. Barnes (see SDAH 142), and became a fellow of the American Guild of Organists. After earning degrees at the New York University and New York College of Music, he received the D. Mus. from Lincoln and Jefferson University in 1923. His experience included the post of organist at churches in New York City; Wilmington, Delaware; and Rochester, New York. He was very active, serving in several positions in the AGO. His 400 publications include three cantatas, anthems, organ pieces, and hymn tunes. He died at Geneva, New York, on November 23, 1966.\n\nGENEVA was composed in 1940, and first appeared in the Episcopal Hymnal 1940, with the text “Not Alone for Mighty Empire,” by William Pierson Merrill. With this same text it is in Lutheran Book of Worship, 1978. A quick look at the architecture of Day’s tune gives the impression that all four of the lines are basically the same music. However, the change of key from A-flat to F minor halfway through makes the same melody come alive again as fresh and new.",

    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "The words of this favorite gospel song were written by a successful American evangelist of the late nineteenth century. They are based on God’s promise to Israel through the prophet Ezekiel: “I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing” (Eze. 34:26).\n\nMajor Daniel Webster Whittle was born on November 22, 1840, in Chicopee Falls, Massachusetts. While a young man he moved to Chicago and took a job as a cashier in Wells Fargo Bank. During the Civil War he had the rank of second lieutenant, and was provost marshal on General Howard’s staff during General Sherman’s march to the sea. After losing his right arm at the Battle of Vicksburg, Whittle was taken prisoner by Confederates. He became a Christian after reading a copy of the New Testament given to him by his mother. After the close of the war he was promoted to the rank of major, and that was a part of his name for the rest of his life.\n\nAfter a short term as treasurer of the Elgin Watch Company, he met the evangelist D. L. Moody and accepted God’s call to devote his life to the winning of souls for God’s kingdom. The success of his work was helped along by three of the most talented singers of that time, Philip Bliss, George C. Stebbins, and James McGranahan, who wrote the music for this text.\n\nWhittle is also the author of SDAH 507, “Moment by Moment,” and of SDAH 511, “I Know Whom I Have Believed.” For many of his song texts, he used the pseudonym El Nathan.\n\nJames McGranahan was born July 4, 1840, on a farm near Adamsville, Pennsylvania. From childhood he showed a great talent for music and a desire to go to the city and study. Because he was needed on the farm, his father rejected that idea. But James offered to hire a man to take his place; he went to town, got a job, and was successful in making enough money to care for his own expenses and pay the hired man. Upon this, the father relented.\n\nBy age 19 James was already teaching singing classes. After attending William Bradbury’s Normal Music School at Geneseo, New York, he connected with J. F. Towner to conduct musical conventions and singing schools in New York and Pennsylvania from 1861 to 1864. Teachers with whom he studied in New York and Chicago were impressed with his beautiful voice, and advised a career in opera. For three more years he was a teacher in George F. Root’s (see SDAH 88) Normal Musical Institute, gaining a reputation as a cultured musician, soloist, director of choruses, and composer.\n\nUpon receipt of a letter from his good friend Philip Bliss, he was considering giving all this up to enter full-time evangelistic singing when word came of Bliss’s death in a train wreck at Ashtabula, Ohio. Rushing there to see what he could do, McGranahan met Bliss’s partner in work, Major Whittle, whose first thought was: Here stands the man that Mr. Bliss has chosen as his successor. Going back to Chicago together, the two men prayed about it, and James agreed to enter this new work. For 11 years they held great meetings in America and Britain.\n\nMcGranahan was a pioneer in the use of male voices for gospel singing. During a meeting in Worcester, Massachusetts, almost all the women singers were unable to sing for a time. Showing his versatility, McGranahan rearranged the music for male voices, and the meetings proceeded with great power. In 1878 he published Gospel Male Choir, No. 1, and in 1883, No. 2. So what began as an emergency stopgap measure became an effective agency in singing the gospel. (George Stebbins had earlier introduced, in 1872, a male quartet singing gospel songs in his meetings.)\n\nHe coedited, with George Stebbins and Ira Sankey, Gospel Hymns, Nos. 3–6. It was in No. 4 of this series that “Showers of Blessing” was first printed in 1883. He also published Gospel Choir and The Choice: Harvest of Song.\n\nIn 1887 his health broke down, and he retired to his home in Kinsman, Ohio, where he continued to compose music. Some of his best compositions were written during these years. He was not prolific, but a good share of the ones he wrote are still used, bringing blessing to millions. George Stebbins said of him: “The most notable features of his work, as a composer, were originality as expressed in his attractive and flowing melodies, his musicianly skill in the treatment of his themes, and painstaking care in adapting his music to the truth to be sung.” He died at Kinsman, Ohio, on July 7, 1907.\n\nHis other tunes in SDAH, all unnamed, are Nos. 207, “It May Be at Morn”; 343, “I Will Sing of My Redeemer”; and 511, “I Know Whom I Have Believed.”",

    "historicalContext": "Arabella Katherine Hankey, daughter of a London banker, was a member of the Clapham sect of evangelical Christians. She was not in robust health and had been ordered by her doctor to stay in bed for 12 months or face death. She followed his orders, but while confined to bed in the year 1866 she wrote a 55-stanza poem. She used simple language, for from her own experience she recognized that anyone in a weak state of health is not able to cope with complicated expressions and ideas. The first poem was titled “The Story Wanted” and was completed on January 29, 1866. Part 2 was “The Story Told” and was finished on November 18 in the same year. Both were printed in leaflet form in 1867, but there was no refrain; the stanzas, complete in themselves, had four lines only. The poems were printed in book form in 1868 under the title The Old, Old Story and had very wide circulation, being translated into several languages. The story is of redemption, going back to the Garden of Eden and including Jesus’ birth and His earthly ministry.\n\nArabella Hankey was born in Clapham, a southern suburb of London, in 1834. As a schoolgirl she taught a Sunday school class. When she was 18 years old, she started a Bible class for shop assistants and forged contacts that lasted all her life. In spite of the doctor’s warning, she went to South Africa in 1866 to nurse an invalid brother. She returned to London with an increased zeal for missionary work, teaching Bible classes and visiting in hospitals. She died in Westminster, London, on May 9, 1911. She also wrote SDAH 457, “I Love to Tell the Story.”\n\nDuring an international convention of the YMCA held in Montreal, Canada, in 1867, Ira D. Sankey (1840–1908; see Biographies) obtained a copy of the words and sent them to William Howard Doane (1832–1915; see Biographies), who was also a delegate and present at the meeting. While traveling in a stagecoach on a vacation in the White Mountains, Doane composed this tune, EVANGEL, doubling each pair of original stanzas into one stanza and adding a refrain. In a hotel parlor that evening he sang the new composition to the guests; since then the tune has become attached to the words. Hankey had written a tune for her words, and disapproved of a refrain, but this tune with its many intervals of thirds and sixths in the upper parts caught the fancy of congregations.",

    "historicalContext": "Sir Henry Williams Baker (1821–1877; see SDAH 20) wrote the paraphrase of the Shepherd Psalm in 1868, and it appeared in Hymns Ancient and Modern of that year, in six stanzas. The four stanzas in SDAH draw from Psalm 23 as follows: “The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul” and “Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.” It is more than a paraphrase, for Baker has also drawn upon the New Testament in the third stanza (see Luke 15:5, 6). Baker composed a tune for his hymn, but it was not successful, so he asked his friend John Bacchus Dykes (1823–1876; see Biographies) to compose one.\n\nThe result was DOMINUS REGIT ME (The Lord Rules Me), so named from the first three words of the Latin Vulgate Version of Psalm 23. Notice that the descending melody in line 1 is very similar to that in line 3, and that the ascending melody in line 2 is quite similar to that in line 4. The harmony for each, however, is quite different, the mark of a master musician.\n\nBaker also wrote SDAH 20, “O Praise Ye the Lord,” and SDAH 116, “Of the Father’s Love Begotten.”",

    "author": "Charles Wesley",

    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "Charles Wesley (1707–1788; see Biographies) wrote this soon after his conversion (May 1738), for it appeared under the title “Free Grace” in Psalms and Hymns, 1738, and also in Hymns and Sacred Poems, 1739. It is a profound study of the atonement by one who was deeply touched by the mystery and significance of the death of Christ. In his journal, May 21, 1738, he records: “At 9 I began a hymn on my conversion but was persuaded to break off for fear of pride. I prayed Christ to stand by me and finished the hymn.”\n\nBoth John and Charles Wesley often told in their journals how they made use of hymns in their evangelistic ministry. The August 22, 1739, entry in Charles’s journal tells how this hymn was used by the Holy Spirit in the conviction and conversion of a drunken servant of a Mr. Seward: “This morning the work upon poor Robin appeared to be God’s work. The words that made the first impression were [from stanza 2]:\n\n’Tis mercy all, immense and free;\nFor, O my God, it found out me!\n\nHe now seems full of sorrow and joy and astonishment and love.”\n\nNotice how the third stanza uses the poetic analogy of being freed by the grace of God from a prisonhouse of sin. Peter’s miraculous release from prison (Acts 12:7–9) is remembered by the phrases “dungeon flamed with light,” “my chains fell off,” and “I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.”\n\nThe tune SAGINA is the only survivor from The Bouquet, 1825, which was published by Thomas Campbell. The book had 23 of his original tunes, to all of which he gave botanical names. Sagina is a plant of the pink family that grows in low-lying marshy areas and provides fodder in springtime for grazing sheep. Thomas Campbell, of whom little is known, was born in Sheffield and is not the poet of the same name mentioned in Grove’s Dictionary of Music and Musicians.",

    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "Some hymnals place this in the Ascension section or the Kingdom and Reign section. But it also finds an appropriate place in the Love of Christ for Us section, for His love made Him leave heaven and accept the crown of thorns and the death on the cross, in order that we might have life eternal. In fact, Kelly’s title was “perfect through sufferings” (Heb. 2:10). Primarily it is based on Hebrews 2:9, “But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.” Thomas Kelly (1769–1855; see SDAH 165) issued the fifth edition of Hymns on Various Passages of Scripture, 1820, in which this hymn appeared. Kelly also wrote SDAH 165, “Look, You Saints! the Sight Is Glorious,” and SDAH 222, “Hark! Ten Thousand Harps and Voices.”\n\nST. MAGNUS is generally attributed to Jeremiah Clark (1669–1707; see SDAH 19), whom Robert Bridges called “The Inventor of the Modern Hymn Tune.” Another tune by him in SDAH is No. 644, BISHOP. ST. MAGNUS was first printed in Henry Playford’s Divine Companion, where it was set to a metrical version of Psalm 117.\n\nSDAH’s arrangement is by Melvin West (1930–; see Biographies). For a different harmonization of the tune, see SDAH 19.",

    "authorBirthDeath": "1858–1947",
    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": 1886,
    "historicalContext": "We are told that the early Adventist believers would greet each other with the word Maranatha, which means “The Lord is coming” (see 1 Cor. 16:22). This seems to be borne out by the lines from the first stanza, “And when we meet and when we part, the salutation from the heart.” James White (1821–1881) included this anonymous poem in his second little hymnal, Hymns for Those Who Keep the Commandments of God and the Faith of Jesus, 1855, printed on the steam press at Rochester, New York. (The first hymnal he edited was in 1849.) Evidently this hymn was much loved among the Advent believers, for it is found in nearly every SDA hymnal printed since then.\n\nIn the original were also these stanzas:\n\nThe fourth stanza in SDAH is the second stanza of another hymn by Mary A. Steward (1858–1947) that had the same title, “The Lord Is Coming,” No. 885 in the Seventh-day Adventist Hymn and Tune Book, 1886, most often referred to as Hymns and Tunes.\n\nThe Seventh-day Adventist Encyclopedia gives the following account of Mary A. Steward: “Chief compiler and editor of the first Index to the Writings of Ellen G. White. She was a daughter of a pioneer SDA minister, T. M. Steward, and was educated at Battle Creek College. In 1880 she joined the staff of the Review and Herald as a proofreader; in 1892 she went to work for Dr. J. H. Kellogg; about the year 1900 she became one of Mrs. White’s office assistants, going with her to Tennessee, where she remained to teach at Graysville Academy and to work in the proofroom of the Southern Publishing Association. In 1906 she rejoined the staff of Mrs. White and remained there until Mrs. White died [1915]. Afterward she worked as copy editor at the Review and Herald until 1937.”\n\nIt is not known what tune the pioneers used for this Long Meter hymn. The Church Hymnal, 1941, carried over WARRINGTON from Hymns and Tunes, but according to a survey of pastors, it never really caught on and was seldom sung. The committee decided to wed this historic text to the well-known tune THE SOLID ROCK, which is also retained for use with the text “My Hope Is Built on Nothing Less” (see SDAH 522). The tune is by William B. Bradbury (1816–1868; see Biographies).\n\nThis harmonization is by Melvin West (1930–; see Biographies). For variety in performance, sing two or three stanzas with the accompanist playing SDAH 522. Then on the final stanza, ask all to sing in unison on the melody while the accompanist plays West’s harmonization for SDAH 200; as a descant, the sopranos sing the alto part an octave higher.",

    "historicalContext": "Under the title “Second Advent,” this hymn was first printed in a book of hymns by John MacDuff, Altar Stones, 1853. He prefaced it by a quotation from Revelation 1:7, “Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him,” and from Revelation 22:20, “He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.” MacDuff obviously believed in the premillennial second coming of Christ as a literal event, just as Seventh-day Adventists do. This scripturally based hymn held a place in many older denominational hymnbooks, but it has been left out of modern hymnals because of widely held views that the Second Coming happens when Christ comes into our lives and universal love fills the hearts of everyone. For example, “Christ Is Coming” was in the Methodist Hymnal, 1905, but was deleted in the 1933 and 1964 editions.\n\nJohn Ross MacDuff was born May 23, 1818, at Bonhard, Perthshire, Scotland. He went to the University of Edinburgh and studied three years under the famous Thomas Chalmers, who influenced him to give his life to the gospel ministry. He did not go along with Disruption in 1843, when secession from the state church resulted in the formation of the Free Church of Scotland, but was ordained in 1842 by the Established Church of Scotland. After serving several small parishes, he was given a magnificent new church with a large congregation at Sandyford, a part of Glasgow, where he stayed for 15 years. He declined an offer from the Crown to go to the Cathedral Church in Glasgow, and in 1871 gave up his pastoral duties to devote his entire time to literary pursuits. Among his very successful books are Faithful Promise, Morning and Night Watches, and The Mind and Words of Jesus. A definitive book of his hymn texts, Gates of Praise, was published in 1875. He was a member of the hymnal committee of the Church of Scotland, and honorary D.D. degrees were conferred on him by the Universities of Edinburgh, Glasgow, and New York. He died at Chislehurst, Kent, England, on April 30, 1895.\n\nCWM RHONDDA is one of the most used of the great Welsh tunes, and has been very popular in America. Cwm is Welsh for valley, and Rhondda is the name of the river the runs through the heart of the coal-mining area of south Wales. The tune was written by John Hughes for a Baptist singing festival held at Capel Rhondda, Pontypridd, Wales, about 1905. The Welsh name for the hymn singing festival is Cymanfa Ganu; it is still a much-loved event in Wales, United States, and Canada.\n\nJohn Hughes was born November 22, 1873, at Dowlais, Wales, but in his first year his parents moved to the mining village of Llantwitfarder, south of Pontypridd in Galmorganshire. Here he spent his life, first as a doorboy at a coal mine, and later in traffic department of the Great Western Colliery Company. He was an active member of Salem Baptist Church at Llantwitfarder all his life, and followed his father as deacon and precentor (leader of the singing) Even though he had no formal music training that we know of, his natural musical gift resulted in the writing of several hymn tunes, anthems, and Sunday school songs. He died May 14, 193.\n\nCWM RHONDDA is also used, in key one-half step lower, for SDAH 415 and 538\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "Both words and music of this martial hymn composed by Henry de Fluiter in 1916.They offer a remarkable contrast to the dark days of Allied setbacks and retreat in World War I, especially when viewed in the context of the glorious day when the Prince of Peace shall put an end to war and take His rightful place as king of glory.\n\n“This is what I am going to do when I grow up. I will draw beautiful music from people just as Mr.Sankey is doing here.” Henry de Fluiter spoke these words when, as a young man, he heard the great Moody-Sankey crowds sing in Cleveland, Ohio. Henry’s family had moved from Hilversum, Holland, where he was born in 1872, to America when Henry was but a small boy. He was apprenticed to a signs for camp meetings and evangelistic meetings. When his parents moved away, Henry stayed on with the Martins. He read about the Seventh-day Adventist faith in books from a colporteur, and hurried to tell his parents about his newfound faith, only to find that they too, in another city, had also bought books and read their way into the same church!\n\nNew Henry was determined to work for the Lord, and enrolled in the music/Bible at course at Moody Bible Institute in Chicago. After one year he assisted SDA pastor-evangelist D. E. Lindsey in some Ohio meetings, being paid $5 per week from private donations. (The conference officers, when requested to pay the singer, had said, “Whoever heard of hiring someone just to help with the music?”)  During these meetings he wrote his first song, Matthew Twenty-four,” about the second Coming prophecies. Moving to Denver, Colorado, in 1909, he met H.M.S. Richards, an academy student. But many years would pass before they joined hands in the work. Henry sang for R. E. Harter in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., and spent two years in New York City with evangelist Charles T. Everson. Between campaigns he would return to his sign painting, but his heart was not in it. Praying for God to open the way for full-time music ministry, he traveled to the General Conference session in Milwaukee in 1926, and there accepted the invitation to  go to California with H.M.S. Richards. For 12 years these two “giants” worked together in big-tent and tabernacle evangelism, baptizing literally thousands in the large cities of California. Many of De Fluiter’s songs were inspired by the sermons of Richards, and often he would sing a new one at the close. Their final camping ( after Richards started his successful radio ministry, Voice of Prophecy ) was in North Hollywood, where a new church was organized with “Uncle Henry”, as he was now lovingly known, as the first pastor. In 1966, at the age of 94, he came to the Voice of Prophecy studios in Glendale and tool part in a special broadcast featuring music. He testified, “I don’t have an ache or pain. My greatest desire is to be alive when Jesus comes.” Then he launches into enthusiastic plans for directing a choir of 1,000 voices in heaven.\n\nFor “Uncle Henry’s” pen flowed the words and music of some 200 gospel songs, most of them on the subject of heaven and the Second Coming. Many of them were first printed as leaflets and given away in meetings. In 1943 he published Bible Songs, 120 songs that were mostly his, and about 1953, Christ Centered Songs, with 53 items. He was still writing songs just a few months before his death at age 98 in a rest home at Azusa, California. His best-known songs were “Ride On, King Jesus,” “ Longing,” “ Homesick for Heaven,” “Always,” “Deep in My Heart,” “Wonderful Love for Me,” and “Over Yonder” (see SDA 431).\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "The triple exclamation that concludes each stanza of this hymn comes from ancient sources, and has appeared in some recent works also. Fred Pratt Green (1903-;   see Biographies), Methodist minister of England who is considered in the forefront of contemporary hymn writers, used these three major events in the life of our Lord to make a stirring hymn.\n\nAn anthem had been composed using this text, which was printed in The Hymns and Ballads of Fred Pratt Green, published in 1982 by Hope Publishing Company. The commentary in that book said, “Fred hopes someone will write a tune for it in the form of a hymn.” The committee decided to fulfill this hope, and sent the poem to some 30 SDA composers, asking for an original tune. Out of all those submitted, CHALLENGE, by Allen W. Foster (1940-; see SDAH 151), was chosen as the one that best gave wings to this text. The SDA Committee especially liked the upward movement of the refrain, building naturally to the “Christ will come again!” climax.\n\nConcerning this music, foster wrote: “The hymn tune name I chose CHALLENGE, seemed appropriate to the pleasant task of fitting a tune to these challenging and inspirational words. My method of writing tunes for existing texts has always been meter-based—how the words flow from my personal reading of them. Often, from the meter, a tune will literally jump out! This is how the tune CHALLENGE managed to create a bond with the great Fred Pratt Green hymn text.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "Grant Colfax Tullar, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church and a public evangelist, was staying in the home of Charles L. Mead, a fellow minister, in Rutherford, New Jersey, while assisting in an evangelistic campaign. At one meal there was a small quantity of jelly left over, and Mead, knowing of Tullar’s fondness for it, promised it all to him. Tullar said, “So this is all for me.” Immediately the last three words registered in his mind as a theme for a gospel song. Forsaking the mundane idea of jelly, he went straight to the piano and began to compose words and music, beginning with the words:\n\nAs for me the Saviour suffered, \nAll for me He bled and died.\n\nTelling the story of its spontaneous composition and singing it at the evangelistic meeting that evening, Tullar called it the jelly song. However, he decided to revise the words, felling that they had been rather rapidly written and could be improved. In his mail the next morning he received several poems from Mrs. Frank A. (Carrie Ellis) Breck. One of them, “Face to Face,” was in the exact meter of jelly song. So he set the words to his music, and they have been together ever since.\n\nCarrie Ellis was born January 22, 1855, in Walden, Vermont. She and her husband, Frank Breck, and five daughters were deeply committed Presbyterians. She wrote verse for religious periodicals, and in all wrote about 1,500 hymn texts, in spite of having no sense of pitch. Most of her poems were written while she was engaged in housework. She died in Portland, Oregon, March 27, 1934.\n\nTullar, born August 5, 1869, at Bolton, Connecticut, was given his Christian names Grant Colfax after the then president and vice president of the United States. He was converted at the age of 19 at a Methodist camp meeting. For 10 years he was the song leader for evangelist Geoge Hilton. In 1893 he founded music published house with Isaac Meredith, and was its president for more than 30 years. He edited many hymnals and gospel songbooks. This hymn, “Face To Face,” which was written in 1898, was published in his sermons in song in 1899. He died May 20, 1950, at Ocean Grove, New Jersey.  Nice job! Keep up the good work.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

Turner, who evidently had a lively anticipation of the second advent of the Lord, but we have no information about his life.\n\nThe tune, named CHRIST RETURNETH in Church Hymnal, was specially composed for these words by James McGranahan (1840-1907; see SDAH 195). He also composed the tunes, all unnamed, for SDAH195, “Showers of Blessing”; SDAH 343, “ I Will Sing of My Redeemer”; and SDAH 511, “I Know Whom I Have Believed.”\n\nAccording to the Dictionary of American Hymnology, First Line Index, the first time this song was used was in F.E. Belden’s Christ in Song, 1900. On the card in this listing is the note “Refrain by F.E. Belden,” but he is not given this credit in later books.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "William Orcutt Crushing was born December 31, 1823, to Unitarian parents at Hingham Center, Massachusetts. At age 18 he made a decision to prepare for the ministry. After completing his education, he served as pastor of several churches in the state of New York, beloved by his flocks as a gentle, sweet-spirited. Generous almost to a fault, he once gave $1,000, which was all he had, to a blind girl to help her get an education.\n\nAfter the death of his wife, who had been very ill for many years, he suffered a stroke and was forced to retire from active ministry. But he offered this prayer, “Lord, still give me something to do for Thee!”  His prayer was answered, for he was inspired to write more than 300 hymn and gospel song texts that were set to music by George F. Root, Robert Lowry Hubert P. Main, Ira D. Sankey, and other distinguished composers.in addition to the three listed below, he was the author of the words of “Ring the Bells of Heaven” and Beautiful Valley of Eden.”\n\nThe last 13 years of his life were spent if the hospitable home of Rev. and Mrs. E.E. Curtis, Lisbon Center, New York. While there he joined the Wesleyan Methodist Church. He died October 19, 1902.\n\nThere more of his texts are in SDAH: No. 218 “When He Cometh”; No. 525, “Hiding in Thee”; and No. 529, “Under His Wings.”\n\nIra D. Sankey (1840-1908; see Biographies) said that he used only the first line Crushing’s poem, “There’ll be no dark valley when Jesus comes,” as a basis for this tune. With its repetition of one idea, and syncopated rhythm, the music is very much akin to the spiritual and folk song, and a joy to sing. In Sankey’s My Life and the Story of the Gospel Hymns, he tells this story: “One night during the Boxer revolt, when the Chinese had set fire to many buildings, and it seemed as though all the missionaries and native Christians in a besieged city would be destroyed, the children belonging to the Junior Christian Endeavor society held a meeting in a chapel. While the cracklings of the flames, the sharp report of the Chinese guns, and the cries of men and women running to and fro were rending the air, these little disciples of Jesus were singing, ‘There’ll be no dark valley when Jesus comes.’”\n\nThis is a hymn that the SDAH Committee “brought back” from the much-loved book, Christ in the Song, 1908, compiled and published by F. E. Company. It appeared in Sankey’s Sacred Songs and Solos, 1,200 pieces, 1903, with Psalm 23:4 at the head: “Yea though I walk through the valley…”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Both words and music of this hymn were by Philip Nicolai (1556-1608; see SDAH 18), a most eloquent Lutheran preacher. In 1597 he was the pastor in the small town of Unna in Westphalia, at a time when the bubonic plague was sweeping through Europe. In his own town more than 1,400 people died, and occasionally he officiated at 30 funerals in one day. The rectory was right opposite the cemetery, and the continual funeral processions caused him to meditate deeply concerning death. His thoughts transcended the gloom, however, for he looked beyond the grim specter of death to the eternal God in heaven, and to everlasting life in His presence. Two years later, in 1599, he published a hymnbook as a testimony to the blessed hope of eternal life and to his own peace of mind, endeavoring by his words to give comfort to others. In the book he included this poem entitled “Of the Voice at Midnight,” basing it in the parable on the ten virgins:  “And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps” (Matt. 25:6,   7).\n\nThe present translation, entitled “the Final Joy,” made in the original meter, appears in Lyra Gremanica, Second Series, 1858, by Catherine Winkworth (1827-1878; see Biographies). Several changes have been made from her translation.\n\nWACHET AUF in named after the first lines of the German chorale “Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme”   (Wake up, the voice is calling us). The melody may have been suggested to Nicolai from an earlier tune, it has been harmonized by Johann Sebastian Bach (1985- 1750; see Biographies), and used by Mendelssohn in the overture to his oratorio St. Paul. Nicolai also wrote the words and music of SDAH 18, “O Morning Star, How Fair and Bright,” to the tune WIE SCHON LEUCHTET.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "In 1750 John Cennick wrote a hymn beginning “Lo! He cometh, countless trumpets blow His bloody sign!” which was first published in his Collection of Sacred Hymns, 1752. It was in six stanzas and was used as a basis for the present hymn, most of which was written by Charles Wesley (1707-1788; see Biographies), and published in four stanzas in his Hymns of Intercession for All Mankind, 1758. Martin Madan used both Cennick’s and Wesley’s hymn and with some alterations produced a hymn of six stanzas that appeared in his Collection of Psalms and Hymns, 1760. Wesley’s first two stanzas are only slightly changed, but his third stanza is completely omitted.\n\nSDAH’s third stanza has been altered again from Madan’s version, which had as its first line, “Ev’ry Island, sea, and mountain,” and as its fourth, “Hear the trump proclaim the day.”\n\nJohn Cennick was born in Reading, Berkshire, England, on December 12, 1718. Of Quaker descent, he was brought up in the Church of England. He was a land surveyor, but after becoming acquainted with the Wesley brothers in 1739 he was appointed as a teacher in a school for the children of mine workers in Kingwood, Bristol, in 1740. He became a lay preacher but dissociated with Wesley very soon on doctrinal issues and joined George Whitefield until 1745. Then he joined the Moravian Church and was ordained as a deacon, working in Germany and in Northern Ireland. He published four volumes of hymns and two volumes of sermons. He died in London on July 4, 1755.\n\nMartin Madan was born in 1726 at Hertingfordbury, near Hertford, in the county of the same name, in England. He trained for legal profession but underwent a through conversion and change of aim after hearing John Wesley preach on the text “Prepare to meet thy God.” He was ordained and became a popular preacher, and founded and became chaplain of the Lock Hospital, Hyde Park Corner, London. However, he gave up preaching after the publication of his book, which advocated polygamy. He published A Commentary on the Articles of the Church of England, other theological articles, and his Collection of Psalms and Hymns, which, although unsystematic, had a great influence on the hymnody of the Anglican Church. He died at Epsom Surrey, on May 2, 1790.\n\nHOLYWOOD occurs in a compilation dated 1751, entitled Cantus Diversi (various songs), by John Francis Wade (c. 1711-1786; see SDAH 132). The tune ADESTE FIDELES, SDA 132, was also in this collection.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "yearWritten": 1962,
    "historicalContext": "Wayne Hooper (1920-; see Biographies), the author and composer of this song, was at the time a member of the King’s Heralds Quartet of the Voice of Prophecy radio broadcast. He was asked to serve on a special committee appointed to prepare music for the quadrennial session of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists to be held in San Francisco in 1962. He gives the Following account of how this theme song came to be written:\n\n“Charles Keymer, chairman of the music committee, encouraged me to try my hand at writing a theme song for them to consider. For several years I have been making a special study of the symphonies  of Brahms in my graduate study program at nearby Occidental College to see our son, I started thinking about the motto that had been chosen, “ We Have This Hope.”  All of a sudden, the four notes following the pickup note in the final theme of Brahms’ Fourth Symphony No. 1 in C Minor came to mind as fitting those four words exactly. I had been praying that if it were the Lord’s will that I write something combination of words and music that would be a blessing to the people at that GC session. In just a matter of half an hour I had all the words and most of the music—the transition section did not come about a week later.\n\n“This is the one time in my life that I feel very certain that I was ‘given’ the musical ideas from Lord. Later it was my privilege to read a book that set down actual conversations with the great Johannes Brahms, in which he told about the steps he took before attempting to compose music. He said, ‘All truly inspired ideas come from God. Beethoven, who was my ideal, was aware of this.’ Then he was asked, ‘how do you contact Omnipotence? Most people find Him very aloof.’ Then Brahms told how he would study the Bible, especially the fourteenth chapter of John, where it says, ‘…not I, the Father that dwelleth within me, he doeth the works,” and John 17, where it says, ‘I and my Father are one.’ He went on to say, ‘I always contemplate this before commencing to compose. This is the first step. When I feel the urge I begin by appealing directly to my Maker, and I first ask Him the three most important questions pertaining to our life here in this world. Where did we come from? Why are we here? Whither are we going?... Above all I realize at such moments the tremendous significance of Jesus’ supreme revelation “I and my Father are one.” These vibrations assume the form of distinct mental images, after I have formulated my desire and resolve in regard to what I want—namely, to be inspired so that I can compose something that will uplift and benefit humanity, something of permanent value.\n\n“ ‘Straightway the ideas flow in upon me directly from God, and not only do I see distinct themes in my mind’s eye, but they are clothed in the right forms, harmonies, and orchestration. Measure by measure the finished product is revealed to me when I am in those rare inspired moods’ (Arthur M. Abell, Talks With the Great Composers [New York: Philosophical Library, 1955]).\n\n“So it is evident that Brahms prepared his mind, and asked for divine help—but admits that it was only rarely that the finished product was given him, note for note.\n\n“I had feelings very close to these while riding in the car that day. ‘We Have This Hope’ came to me almost all at once as a gift from God.”\n\nIn addition to the meeting it was written for in 1962, the song was again used as a theme song for the General Conference sessions held in Detroit, Michigan, 1966; in Vienna, Austria, 1975; and in Utrecht, Netherlands, 1995. For the latter meeting, Hooper added a second stanza, based on the motto chosen for the session, “United in Christ.”\n\nThe tune name GENERAL CONFERENCE is of course derived from the gathering that brought about its writing.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "This hymn of seven stanzas was first published by John Brownlie in 1907 in Hymns From the East, a collection of translations of Greek hymns, although no original of this one has been located, and it may be an original from the author himself.\n\nJohn Brownlie was born in Glasgow, Scotland, on August 3 or 6, 1857 some say 1859). He studied at the university there and also at the Free Church College. He was granted his license to preach in 1884; in 1885 he became assistant minister of the Free Church in Portpatrick, Wigtownshire, now Dumfries-Galloway. On the death of his superior in 1890, he took full charge of the church there. He tool great interest in education locally and in larger town of Stranraer, 10 miles across the peninsula. His greatest work was the translation on many Latin and Greek hymns, the latter being a largely unworked field except for John Manson Neale’s efforts. His publications include Hymns of Our Pilgrimage, 1889; Zionward, 1890 Pilgrim Songs, 1892; Hymns and Hymn Writers of the Church Hymnary, 1899; Hymns of the Early Church, 1896 Hymns form East and West, 1898; Hymns of the Greek Church, 1900; and others. Brownlie died at Crieff in Perthshire, on November 18, 1925.\n\nMORNING SONG, also called CONSOLATION, first appeared in John Wyeth’s Repository of Sacred Music, 1813, set to hymn by Isaac Watts. It is also used for SDAH 576, “Awake, Awake to Love and Work.”\n\nJohn Wyeth was born on Cambridge, Massachusetts, on March 31, 1770; he became a printer and publisher in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He published his first Repository of Sacred music in 1810, which collected standard psalm tunes, for which there was a great demand at that time at camp meetings and revival meetings in Pennsylvania. Wyeth, a Unitarian, was not a musician, but his two volumes had enormous sales among other fellowships. He died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on January 23, 1858.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "James Milton Black was born on August 19, 1856, at South Hill, New York. After an education in singing and organ, he became a teacher of what was known as a “singing school.” A visiting teacher would come into a community and enroll students for a course in the rudiments of music, including sight and singing, conducting, and choral singing. It usually lasted for a week or two, and at the end a concert was given for the whole community to hear.\n\nBlack was editor of a dozen or so books of gospel songs, the best-seller of which was Songs of the Soul, 1894, selling 400,000 copies in two years’ time! He was a Methodist, and served on the Joint Commission for the Methodist Hymnal, 1905, but not one of his own songs was included in that book. His membership for 34 years was at the Williamsport, Pennsylvania, Methodist Church. He died December 21, 1938.\n\nIra D. Sankey, in his book My Life and the Story of Gospel Hymns, gives Black’s own story of the writing of this song. As a teacher in Sunday school, Black took particular interest in the salvation of a certain 14-year old girl, the child of a drunkard. She joined the young people’s society of which Black was president. At each meeting, members were to answer the roll call by repeating Scriptures texts, but one evening this girl failed to respond. Black spoke of what a sad thing it would be, when the names are called from the Lamb’s book of life, if anyone should be absent. Black cried, “O God, when my own name is called up yonder, may I be there to respond!” On his way home that evening he wished for a song on the subject. The thought came, why don’t you make it? He dismissed the idea at first, but when he reached home his wife asked why he looked so troubled. Then the words of the first stanza came to him, and in 15 minutes he had added two more stanzas. He went to the piano and played the music just as it is now. Black said, “I have never dared to change a single word or note of the piece since.” This song does not appear in many modern-day books, and the committee brought it “back” from Christ in Song, 1908, and Gospel in Song, 1926, both published by Review and Herald Publishing Association.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "These words were written by Horatius Bonar (1808-1889; see SDAH 79) and published in his Bible Hymn Book, 1845. There were five stanzas of eight lines each, followed by a short refrain – “Come then, Lord Jesus, come,” which is the exact sentiment of Revelation 22:20: “Even so, come, Lord Jesus.” As is to be expected in such a hymn, the Scripture allusions are all from the book of Revelation.\n\nBonar also wrote SDAH 79, “O Love of God, How Strong and True!”; SDAH 298, “I Lay My Sins on Jesus”; and SDAH 465, “I Heard the Voice of Jesus.”\n\nHoratio William Parker was born in Auburndale, Massachusetts, on September 15, 1863. After a regular private school education, he became, at age 16, organist of a small church at Dedham, Massachusetts, and later at St. John’s in Roxbury. At 19 he traveled to Munich and studied music under Rheinberger and Abel. Back home in 1885, he served as a teacher at Long Island and at the National Conservatory in New York. After organ posts at several churches, he received the M.A. degree from Yale, remaining there be professor of music, and in 1904 dean of the school of music. He was conductor of choral groups in New York and Philadelphia, and of the New Heaven Symphony Orchestra. The musical editor of Episcopal Hymnal, 1892, he was also on the Joint Commission for their Hymnal, 1916. He died in Cedarhurst, New York, December 18,1919. His compositions included the oratorio Hora Novaissima, two operas, and works for orchestra, chorus, and organ. He is recognized as one of America’s distinguished composers. GARDEN CITY was composed in 1890 especially for dedication, of a new church building in Garden City, Long Island. Later Parker grew to dislike the tune immensely, and would have recalled it if that had been possible! Some have conjectured the reason might have been that the first musical phrase is repeated immediately, almost like a false start, bringing us half way through the hymn without really arriving anywhere.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Born August 26, 1890, of Swedish Christian parents in Lowell, Massachusetts, Samuel Martin Miller was given to the Lord before his birth. One of nine children, he learned early to work at odd to help the family. Felling a call to the ministry, he entered Upsala College at Kenilworth, New Jersey, and graduated in 1910. Graduate study was at the Augustana Lutheran Rock Island Seminary minister in 1913, and he earned a D.D. at Upsala in 1926. Ordained a Lutheran minister in 1913, he served pastorates in Moline, Illinois; Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota; Jamestown, New York; and Pierson, Florida. Much of his ministry was institutional; he spent 22 years at the Lutheran Bible Institute, Omaha. Retiring in 1955, he spent 5 years working for the Department of Evangelism, Augustana Lutheran Church. He died at Orange City, Minnesota, February 26,1973.\n\nThe author of a number of inspirational books, Miller also wrote articles and editorials for the Bible Banner, organ of the Lutheran Bible Institute. In 1936, while at the Bible Institute, he published a collection of songs entitled Jesus Only and other salvation, which contained “When Jesus Comes in Glory.” In the forward he said: “I am neither a poet nor a musician. The only excuse for publishing this little book of songs is that so many friends have asked for them. Then, too, I pray that they may truly be a testimony for the Lord Jesus Christ. I rejoice in the experience of the grace of God which had convicted me of sin, caused me to confess, opened my eyes to see that Christ has died for me, and helped me in faith to turn myself over to my Savior. These personal experience have caused little songs to sing in my heart, and I have at times been enabled to bring them out in the form here present.”\n\nNORWICK was submitted for consideration by the music committee of Methodist Hymn Book, 1933, for the text “O Jesus I Have Promised,” and was accepted and printed with those words. The composer named it for the helmet where he lived at the time, in the Shetland Islands.\n\nBertram Ernest Woods (1900-1982) was born in England, and began composing anthems, songs, and piano pieces at age 17. After training for the Methodist ministry, he was ordained in 1924 at Didsbury College. He served in the following circuits: Scarborough, North Isles, Swindon, Sunderland, at Glasgow Central Mission, and London Mission at Wandswoth Road. Other pastorates were at Brixton Hill and Redhill Circuit at Horley. Retiring in 1968, he lived at Penzance, Cornwall, England, until his death in 1982.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "Timothy Dudley-Smith (1926-; see   Biographies) is bishop of Thetford, in the Anglican diocese of Norwich, England. He is considered to be one of several writers who brought about the “hymn-writing explosion” in England of the 1960s and 1970s. he shares the circumstance of its writing. ‘This text began as something I sang to myself on a car journey in 1967. Paul’s phrase in 1 Thessalonians 4:17 is ‘Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the lord in the air...,’ and I take this as justification for a text written from the viewpoint of those who will be alive when the Lord returns at His second advent. I admit that the ‘alleluias’ are an inference of mine own; but Paul says that we are to ‘encourage one another’ with what he here tells us; and ‘alleluia’ seems to me a fitting accompaniment to this encouragement!”\n\nThe hymn was set to music by J. D. Thornton and published in Youth Praise 2, 1969, and in several later collections. DAVID is named after the composer’s third child, who is a physician is California. Wayne Hooper (1920-; see Biographies) shares this about how the music was written: I was looking through A Collection of Hymns, 1961-1981 by Timothy Dudley-Smith, and was struck by this text, which carefully follows the Scriptures so well known in the Seventh-day Adventist Church. I thought, this is not the modernist view of the Second Coming, but a celebration of that soon-to-happen literal event when we will ‘here the trumpets sound, and all rise up to meet Him when He comes!’ The repetition of several phrase placed it in the style of the spirituals and gospel songs that have had a prominent place in my career of public and radio evangelism. So the music melody to a chorus song written by Professor Harold Miller [see SDAH 492], titled ‘Let It Shine,’ which we used a lot back in the 1950s when the King’s Herald Quarter Conduct Weeks of Prayer on several academies and colleges.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "This hymn by Charles Wesley (1707-1788; see Biographies) was written in 1744 and first appeared in John Wesley’s Moral and Sacred Poems. It was republished by Charles in the Hymns for Our Lord’s Resurrection, with six stanzas. Each of these stanzas concluded with the exultant refrain of rejoicing, but Wesley concluded his last stanza with the stirring couplet:\n\nWe soon shall hear the Archangel’s voice, the trump of God shall sound, rejoice. This is one of three Wesley hymns for which Handel wrote tunes. GOSPEL, which he composed for this text, is not included in SDAH. When Samuel Wesley discovered these tunes he said, “My dear Father’s poetry must have highly delighted Handel.”\n\nAt the Wesley Museum, Lake Junaluska, North Carolina, is a book titled Hymns on the Great Festivals and Other Occasions, London, 1746. It contains a number of Wesley’s hymns in poem form; the first stanzas are within the music, which was composed by John F. Lampe. Hymn No. 8, headed “On the Resurrection,” is “Rejoice, the Lord is King” (see reproduction on page 264). Lampe’s style was florid and difficult to sing (notice the grace notes reveres dotted rhythms. And a melodic leap of and octave and a third), but the Methodist of that day loved and sang them. DARLWELL’s 148TH, named for the composer and the psalm for which he wrote it, “Ye Boundless Realms of Joy,” was first used in Aaron William’s New Universal Psalmist, 1770. The original, in two parts, melody and bass, was in the key of D and the beginning note of the melody was A. It seems to be the only tune from that psalter that has survived. The unusual meter, 6.6.6.6.8.8., was called the “Hallelujah Meter” in some early American hymnals because of its exuberance and joyfulness.\n\nErik Routley (see SDAH 571) says this is one of those rare cases where “discreet editorial assistance and liberate qualities slightly obscures in an original.” In this case the tonic was substituted for the fifth at the beginning, and a more contrapuntal bass was provided. That has made this tune, as Routley says, one of the best loved tunes. SDAH also uses this for No. 377, “Go Forth with Christ.” Note the arpeggio in the first line of the melody, the descent of the seven successive notes of the scale as line 1 merges with line 2, and then the ascending octave plus one note beyond in lines 5 and 6.\n\nJohn Darwall was born in the village of Haughton, Staffordshire, England, in January 1731. As Oxford graduate, he served as curate, then 20 years as vicar, of St. Matthew’s Church, Walsall, where this tune was first sung on Whitsunday in 1713. He died there on December 18, 1789. As an amateur musician, he wrote two volumes of piano sonatas, hymn texts, and tunes and composed music for all 150 psalms in part-two harmony.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

It was printed in his Hymns, second edition, 1806. Minor alterations on SDAH include: stanza 1, line 5, changed from “He fills yon azure throne”; stanza 2, line 6, from “Soon they hope to see Thy face,” showing Kelly’s hope on the imminent Advent; and stanza 3, lines 3 and 4, from “When this flesh no longer wearing, all our griefs shall fly away.” Kelly’s title was “Let all the angels of God Worship Him” (Heb. 1:6).\n\nKelly also wrote SDAH 165, “Look You Saints, The Sight Is Glorious,” and SDAH 199, “The Head That Once Was Crowned.” Lowell Mason (1792-1872; see Biographies) has been noted for traveling to Europe, gathering melodies from the works of the great composers, and the incorporating them into his hymn tunes. He wrote this tune in 1841, adding the “alleluias” to the text, and named it after an English residence, or homestead.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Matthew Bridges wrote this hymn of six stanzas and published it in his Hymns of the Heart, 1851. It was revised considerably by Godfrey Thring (1823-1903; see SDAH 360), but the SDAH version is entirely from Bridges. His second stanza, the last of his fifth, and the first half of his sixth have been omitted. Bridges was born in Maldon, Essex, on July 14, 1800. In his youth he was an ardent Protestant, but he became much interested in the Oxford movement and joined the Roman Catholic Church in 1848. He spent some time in Quebec, Canada, but returned to England and lived in a villa in a convent at Sidmouth, Devon. He wrote several books of poems, some commentary on history, and a few hymns. He died at Sidmouth on October 6, 1894. DIADEMATA (Crowns), also used for SDAH 616, “Soldiers of Christ, Arise,” was composed especially for these words in 1868 by Sir George (Job) Elvey, who was born at Canterbury, Kent, on March 27, 1816. He became a chorister on the cathedral and studied at the Royal Academy of Music. He obtained the B. Mus. In 1840. In 1835 he applied for the position of organist at St. George’s Chapel, Windsor, and was appointed above several eminent applicants by King William IV. Knighted by Queen Victoria in 1871, he retired from his position in 1882, having occupied the post for 47 years. During his occupancy at Windsor he taught music to some of the royal family. He also wrote anthems, oratorios, identical music, and hymn tunes. He died at Windlesham, Surrey, on December 9, 1893. He also wrote SDAH 557, ST. GEORGE’S WINDSOR. He believed that church music should be as stately, uplifting, and inspiring as the soaring archers and stained-glass windows of the cathedrals in which it would be rendered.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "When the English hymnbook Congregational Praise, 1953, was in preparation, this poem was submitted to the committee and include in that book. This is the first appearance of this hymn in America. Born October 11, 1893, in Adlington, Lancashire, England, Norman Elliot received his Congregational ministry. After a time as chaplain under the United Army and Navy Board, he pastored churches in Liverpool, Marple Bridge in Derbyshire, and beginning in 1947 was pastor David Thomas Memorial Church in Bristol. He died there on June 13, 1973. CRANHAM was probably named after the composer’s birthplace, Cranham Woods, a beautiful spot near Cheltenham, England. Holst wrote the tune especially for Christiana Rossetti’s poem “In the Bleak Midwinter” (SDAH 126), and it first appeared in the English Hymnal, 1906. SDAH has made some slight changes in the note values to make the tune fit this regular meter text. Erik Routley calls this a “pure folk song.”\n\nBorn September 21, 1874, at Cheltenham, Gustavus Theodore Holst’s was English, his Father Swedish. He studied music at the Royal College of Music, at first heading for a career as a pianist, but he changed and at age 17 became organist at Wyck Rissington in Gloucestershire. For five years he played trombone on the Scottish orchestra and in the Carl Rosa Opera Company, gaining valuable experience that helped him later in composed for orchestra. In 1903 he began teaching music in girls’ school in Reading and London, then in 1919 at the Royal College of Music. As an organizer of music, he worked for the YMCA in Salonica, Constantinople, and Asia Minor.\n\nHe visited America twice, in 1923 to conduct at the Ann Arbor, Michigan, Festival, and to give lectures at Harvard in 1932. He died at Ealing, Middlesex, May 25, 1934, but his ashes lie in Chichester Cathedral. His compositions include a large sacred work, Hymn of Jesus; Ode to Death (Walt Whitman’s text); an Ave Maria for women’s voice; Hymn to the Unknown, the orchestral suite mentioned above; The Planets; five operas; song; and hymn tunes. His tunes THAXTED is at SDAH 648.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "historicalContext": "Each stanza of  this hymn ends with a refrain that is from Habakkuk 2:14 “For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.” It was written in 1894 at the prestigious English school Eton, while the author was an assistant master (teacher) there. One can almost hear the glorious sound of 1,000 clear-voiced boys singing it in the resonant Eton chapel! Ainger dedicated the hymn to Archbishop Benson and published it in leaflet form before it was included in the Church Missionary Hymn Book, 1899. Author Campbell Ainger was born July 4, 1841, at Greenwich, Kent, and education at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he gained first class honors in classical studies. As assistant master at Eton for more than 35 years, he was remembered thus: “One of the most distinguished masters, a man of clear head, wind accomplishments, a fine scholar with a remarkable memory, punishment, and his justice, courtesy, and unruffled good humor won the respect and admiration of the boys.” Some of his poetry was set to music by Joseph Barnby, and he assisted in the publication of an English-Latin Verse Dictionary.\n\nHe died October 26, 1919. Martin Shaw (1875-1958; see Biographies) composed PURPOSE especially for the enlarged Song of Praise, 1931. The following, folk song-like unison melody is so skillfully put together that the bass line is an exact canon throughout, beginning on the downbeat of measure two.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "George Weissel (1590-1635), who was a pastor at Konigsberg from 1623 until his death, and one of Prussia’s important hymn writers, wrote five eight-line stanzas of this hymn, which was published in 1642. It was entitled “Macht Hoch die Tur, das Tor machete weit” (Lift Up the Door, Fling Wide the Gate). It was intended for the first Sunday in Advent. It is based on the psalm that describes the return to heaven of the ascended Christ: “Lift up your hands, O ye gates...  and the King of glory shall come in” (Ps. 24:7). The hymn was translated from the German by Catherin Winkworth (1829-1878; se biographies) in her Lyra Germanica, First Series, 1855. The original meter was 8.8.8.8.8.8.6.8. and was faithfully translated in this meter of each stanza have been omitted, making the hymn a normal Long meter one.\n\nHer heading “Fourth Sunday in Advent. Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say unto you, Rejoice...  The Lord is at hand” (an exact quotation from Philippians 4:4). After opening the lines from Psalm 24, the hymn goes on to draw the spiritual lesson of Christ entering the heart of the believer and uses many Scripture references. WAREHAM was composed in 1738 for Psalm 36:5-10 by William Knapp (1698-1768; see SDAH 174) and named in honor of his birthplace in Wareham, Dorset, England. The same tune, in the lower key of A, is used for SDAH 174, “ Star of Our Hope.” Notice that the melody, with the one exception in line 1 and one other in line 4, proceeds successive notes of the scale.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

It was written by Isaac Watts (1674-1748; see biographies) and appears in his Psalms of David, 1719, entitled: “Psalm 72: Part 2. Christ’s Kingdom among the Gentiles.” There are eight stanzas, those omitted bring 2,3, and 7. One minor change in the last line of the hymn is the word loud for Watts’s word long, where the author was giving full weight to the repetition of the word Amen in Psalm 72:19.\n\nThe tune was composed by John Hatton (c. 1710-1793) who, like Watts, was a dissenter from the Established Church. It was first set to Addison’s Psalm 19 (see SDAH 96).  Note the almost complete ascending octave with which the melody begins. It is named DUKE STREET after the street in St. Helens, Lancashire, where Hattin lived. The same tune, in four-part harmony, is used for SDAH 82, “Before Jehovah’s Awful Throne.” The unison setting here is by Melvin West (1930-; see biographies).\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Bede was born in 673 in an English village that is now the town of Jarrow, near the mouth of the River Tyne, in the country of Tyne and Wear. Becoming an orphan early in life, Bede was set by his relatives to be educated at the nearby monasteries of Wear mouth and Jarrow. For the rest of his life he “found it sweet to learn, or to teach, or to write,” to use his own words. Besides observing the usual discipline and daily rituals of a monk in a monastery, he found time to write his Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation. He is also known and respected for his contributions in the areas of grammar, philosophy, religion, biography, and poetry. This Ascension hymn “Hymnum Canamus Gloriae” first appeared in Latin, and later was translated into English. The Venerable Bede died in 735; his bones were removed to Durham Cathedral in the eleventh century.\n\nThis present English text is the work of two translators, Elizabeth Rundle Charles (see SDAH 70) in his The Hymnal Noted, 1854 with some further reversions from Lutheran Book of Worship, 1978. There were six stanzas in the original, of which SDAH has Nos. 1,5, and 6, plus an added doxology. See SDAH 2 for comment on LASST UNS ERFREUEN. The tune is also used for SDAH 91, “Ye Watchers and Ye Holy Ones,” where it is in a lower key.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "The first stanza of this hymn, written by Edward Perronet, appeared in the November 1779 issue of the Gospel Magazine. The following April 1780, seven more stanzas were printed with the title “On the Resurrection, the Lord is King.” Of these eight original stanzas SDAH has numbers 1 and 5 as the first two. Rippon (1751-1836; see SDAH 509) revised the whole hymn and published it in his Selection of Hymns, 1787. His last two stanzas are SDAH 3 and 4.\n\nCORONATION, so named because it was found to fit the meter of these words, which emphasize a crowning, was written in 1792 by Oliver Holden and appeared in his The Union Harmony or Universal Collection of Sacred Music, 179. It was composed to celebrate the birth of his daughter, with no particular words in mind. Perronet was the son of a vicar of the Church England and born in the village of Sundridge, near Sevenoaks, Kent, in 1726. He studied to be a Church of England clergyman but was disturbed by the corruption in the church, which he attacked in a poem, “The Miter,” in 1757. He withdrew from the Anglican Church and joined the Wesley brothers, undergoing persecution with them. He is mentioned in Wesley’s journal as being rolled in the mud after preaching in Bolton, Lancashire. Volatile, ebullient, and independent, he dissociated with the Wesleys and joined Lady Huntingdon’s Connexion. Then he left her services and became an independent preacher to a small congregation in Canterbury. He wrote three anonymous publication containing his hymns, published in 1756, 1782, and 1785, respectively. He died in Canterbury on January 2, 1792, and was buried in the cathedral there.\n\nOliver Holden was born in Shirley, Massachusetts, in September 18, 1765. He moved with his family to Charlestown at the age of 21. He was a carpenter and helped to rebuild the town, which had been destroyed in the War of Independence. He was a self-taught musician, and he conducted a sinning school and edited several collections of sacred songs and hymns. He was a member of State House Representatives for 15 years, and also a prominent Freemason. He died at Charlestown, Massachusetts, on September 4, 1844.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "Theodulph was born about A. D. 750 of a noble family in Spain. He became abbot of a monastery in Florence, Italy, and then was appointed by Emperor Charlemagne as abbot of Fleury, 34 miles northwest of Paris, in 781. Four years later he was appointed as bishop of Orleans. Charlemagne died in 814, and there was a conspiracy to despose his son Louis the Pious, in which Theodulph was said to be implicated.\n\nHe was imprisoned, in 818 in the cloisters of the church in Angers, near the mouth of the river Loire in France. While imprisoned, he wrote this hymn (in Latin) of 78 lines, paraphrasing the story of the triumphal entry of our Lord into Jerusalem. On a Palm Sunday when the annual procession passed by prison, Theodulph sang his hymn so that it could be heard outside. Louis, who was in the procession, was delighted; he ordered the procession to be halted, and sent for the singer. One story says that the ex-bishop was pardoned on the spot and restored to his see, but another account says that he died of poisoning while in prison in about 821.\n\nJohn Mason Neale (1818-1866; see Biographies) translated the opening stanzas in the original meter for his Mediaeval Hymns, 1851, and then made a revision in the present meter in nine stanzas of four lines each in his Hymnal Noted, 1854.\n\nST. THEODULPH was composed by Melchior Teschner in 1613 for a funeral hymn by his friend Valerius Herberger (1562-1627). The latter was the pastor of a Lutheran congregation at Oberpritschen, a suburb of Fraustadt, Poland, during the great pestilence of 1613-1630, when 2,000 people died in Fraustadt alone. The melody, however, is a very cheerful one, rising from its lowest note, B-flat, to its highest, D, more than an octave higher, and quite suitable for the present words of gladness.\n\nTeschner was born on April 29, 1584, at Fraustadt, now Wschow, Poland. His secondary education was given at Zittau, and in 1602 he studied theology, philosophy, and music at the University of Frankfurt-on-Oder. In 1605 he accepted an appointment as cantor at the village of Schmiegel, saving his money so that he could continue study at the University of Wittenberg. In 1609 he was called to be cantor and teacher at Fraustadt, and from 1614 he was pastor of the church at Oberpritschen, where he remained 21 years until his death on December 1, 1635.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "The Spanish language original of this hymn began “Bendito Rey que viene en el nombre del Senor!” (“Blessed is the king that comes in the name of the Lord”). The hymn is based on the account of Jesus’ triumphal entry into Jerusalem found in Mark 11:9, 10. The central thought of the translation by Fred Pratt Green (1903-; see Biographies) is the humility of Jesus—not robed in royal splendor, but riding on a lowly donkey.\n\nFederico Jose N. Pagura was born at Arroyo Seco, Santa Fe, Argentina, on February 9, 1923. In 1940 he graduated from the Normal School at Rosario, and in 1946 received his B.TH.at Evangelical Faculty of Theology, Buenos Aires. Graduate degrees were earned at Union Theological Seminary, New York, 1949; and at Claremont School of Theology, California, 1969. Ordained a Methodist minister in Argentina in 1950, he served 19 years as a pastor and district superintendent, then for four years as bishop of the Methodist Church in Costa Rica and Panama. Positions of responsibility have included president of the Latin American Council of Churches; copresident of the Ecuminical Movement of Human Rights in Argentina; and membership on the Board of World Mission and Evangelism, World Council of Churches. In addition to articles and booklets, he authored the ABC of Biblical Doctrine and has written and translated many hymns. In 1983 DePauw University   in Indiana awarded him an honorary Doctor of Humanities. Since 1977 Pagura has been bishop of the Evangelical Methodist Church of Argentina.\n\nSTOKESAY CASTLE was originally composed for another text to be printed in Novello’s Sunday School Leaflet series in 1923, but the author’s widow refused permission, and it was set to “Stand Up, Stand Up For Jesus.” The first hymnbook to include the tune was Congregational Praise, 1953, for which Thiman was chairman of the music committee and furnished 16 original hymns tunes and eight descants. Born in Ashford, Kent, England, on September 12, 1900, Eric Harding Thiman went to Caterham School and the Guildhall School of Music. At age 21 he became a Fellow of the Royal College of Organists, and at 27 he earned the D. Mus. Degree from the University of London. For most of his life he was professor of harmony at the Royal Academy of Music; in addition, beginning in 1922 he served as organist at the Congregationalist Park Chapel, Crouch End London. He was much in demand as a recitalist and respected as an adjudicator at music festivals. He was appointed examiner in music for the University of London in 1952, and in 1956 dean of the faculty there. From 1957 to 1975 he was organist at the City Temple, London.\n\nPublications include a large volume of anthems, part-songs, cantatas and organ works, including Varied Harmonies to Thirty-Four Well-known Hymn Tunes (Oxford University Press). In 1953 he was the only non-Anglican on the Council of the Royal College of Organists. Eric Thiman was the first prominent composer among English Congregationalists. His work in the Free Church Choir Union (those outside the Church of England) was very influential in upgrading the quality of church music in these communions. His music is always well-crafted, using conventional materials with a dash here and there of adventuresome harmony. He died in Camden, London, on February 13, 1975.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "historicalContext": "The apostle Paul gave Caroline Maria Noel the gem thought for this hymn, in his letter to the Philippians 2:9, 10: “ God also hath… given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow.” Although the King James Version reads “at”, she reluctantly agreed to change to “in”, as it is in the Revised Standard Version, to avoid the criticism that she might have meant genuflection (bending the knee upon entering the pew). Since then, nearly all hymns have restored the original as she wrote it.\n\nCaroline Marie Noel, born in Teston, Kent, April 10, 1817, was the daughter of Anglican clergyman Gerard Thomas Noel, a writer of hymns. Her first attempt at poetry was at the age of 17, but the inspiration seemed to dry up between the ages of 20 and 40. Protracted illness and much pain brought her back to writing, and for the final 20 years of her life she penned verses with the purpose of bringing help and comfort to those who suffered sickness. She died December 7, 1877.\n\nThis Ascension Day processional hymn was first printed in her book The Name Of Jesus and Other Verses for the Sick and Lonely, 1861, but was written in the previous year. Her family gave 1870 as the year in which the hymn was completed. Many hymns by invalids tend to be self-centered and introspective. But this one is strong and out-ward looking, one stanza giving solid agreement with the Genesis account of Creation, and others naming Jesus as Captain, Savior, and coming King. The original poem has eight stanzas.\n\nThe tunes KING’S WESTON was named after a country house on the river Avon near Bristol, England, which was famous for it’s beautiful park. Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872 – 1958; see Biographies) composed it for this text especially for the hymnbook Songs of Praise, Oxfoed, 1931, of which he was a musical editor. This hymnbook is recognized for its innovative use of new and creative musical ideas and Vaughan Williams’ saturation with the folksong idiom of Britain certainly contributed to this new wave of hymn tune writing. And it is one of those rare occasions when a nationally accepted master composer lent his talents to editing a hymnbook.\n\nThe companion to the hymnal Songs of Praise Discussed states: “ It is a solid tune, in triple time, with a strongly stressed rhythm, and a characteristic exchange of accent in the last two lines; it is  a dignified but not a solemn tune, and must not be sung too slowly. “\n\nKING’S WESTON, in a slightly different harmony setting, is also used for SDAH 581, “When The Church of Jesus.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

Strangely, in the 1780 book John substituted for the first stanza, the second stanza of another hymn, “Lord, How Long Shall I, Shall I.” Not until the 1878 Methodist hymnal in America was the original restored. Alexander MacMillan called it” one of the greatest morning hymns in our language, but it is more. It is a glorious hymn to Christ, the Sun of Righteousness, the light of the World.”\n\nThe tune RATISBON is named after an ancient German City, now known as Regensburg. It is included in J.G. Werner’s Choralbuck zu den neuen  protestanischen Gesangbuchern (Chorale for the New Protestant Hymnbooks), 1851, but was based on an earlier tune. Johann Werner (1777-1822) was born at Hayn, near Leipzig, and held positions as organist at Frohburg, assistant cantor of Hohenstein, and organist-director at Merseburg. He was a teacher and published organ and piano teaching materials and a harmony book.\n\nWilliam Monk (1823-1889; see SDAH 50) made this arrangement for Hymns Ancient and Modern, 1861, for which he was the assistant musical editor. He also wrote the tune VIGILATE, SDAH 603; and EVENTIDE, SDAH 50.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "The committee working in 1969 on a new hymnbook for the Methodist Church in Great Britain asked Fred Pratt Green (1903-; see Biographies) to write a new text for this beautiful old melody. Poetically, it is in the verse form known as sapphic. Though excellent in the Latin language, this form is a little more difficult in English because of the so-called weak, or feminine, endings, which are unaccented on the last syllable, as in the word “singing”. The true Sapphic meter is 11.11.11.5. but Pratt Green shortened the first phrase to 10 syllables and compensated by adding one syllable to the final five, making it six. Then he strengthened it by repeating the first three lines in each stanza and added “Glory to God on high” as a kind of one-line refrain.\n\nCalled by Eric Routley (SDAH 13) a “great creedal utterance,… perhaps the most immediately successful hymn of the recent wave of modern hymn writing in Britain,” it was used as the only modern hymn at the service in Westminster Abbey, London, on October 5, 1972, when the Congregational and Presbyterian churches joined together to form the United Reformed Church. It has found its way  into many hymnbooks in Britain, Canada, America, and Australia, as well as into translations for French and German hymnals.\n\nIn 1980 the Episcopal Church in America, wanting to use it in their new hymnal, asked Pratt Green for permission to make change that would eliminate the male-oriented words. He agreed, but requested that Christ still be “our brother,” and in the final stanza happily accepted the capitalization of the word “Man,” thus denoting the divinity of Christ. The Episcopal Church also asked for the word “Christ” to replace the sixth word “He” in the first three stanzas, but SDAH elected to accept the maleness of Christ as found in the Bible and leave it as Pratt Green originally wrote it.\n\nThe original source of this tune CHRISTE SANCTORUM was the French book Paris Antiphone, 1681. In eighteenth-century Europe there was a transition from the official plainsong chants of the Catholic Church, which were really sung speech with irregular accents and rhythms of speech, to measured rhythms that could be sung by a congregation. In this new form it was printed in La Feillee’s Nouvelle Methode de plain-chant, fifth edition; Paris, 1782. It takes it’s name from its association with the medieval hymn beginning “Christe sanctorum decus angelorum” (O Christ, the glory of the holy angels).\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "This anonymous Latin hymn is based on Ephesians 2:20 and 1 Peter 2:6. The hymns has been found in manuscript dating from the ninth century, but hymn scholars think it is at least two centuries older. The complete poem of nine stanzas begins with a description of the New Jerusalem as given in Revelation 21 and is entitled “Urbs Beata Hierusalem” (The Blessed City of Jerusalem). John Mason Neale (1818-1866; see Biographies) translated this hymn and published it in Medieval Hymns and Sequences, 1851, and revised it in 1861. It is found in most of the medieval rites as the proper hymn for the dedication of a church. It was divided into two hymns, using the last four stanzas and the final doxology for the service of Lauds (sunrise), and the first four stanzas with the doxology at Vespers (sunset).\n\nThe hymn is often sung to REGENT SQUARE, SDAH 119, and WETMINSTER ABBEY, SDAH 607, but the SDAH committee chose the strong minor tune, EDEN CHURCH, composed by Dale Wood (1934-; see SDAH 42). He wrote it first as an anthem with this same text for the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Eden Lutheran Church, Riverside, California, where he was the organist in 1959. As a hymn, it is written to be sung in unison, with organ playing the full accompaniment where needed.\n\nWood also composed LAUREL, which is used for SDAH 42, “Now That Day Light Fills the Sky,” and SDAH 550, “Every Flower That Grows.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "These words were probably written by John Alexander Granade (17?-1807), an American revivalist preacher of the Methodist Church during the early 1800s. He was known as “the wild man of the woods”, and he composed many widely sung hymns. This particular one recalls the apostle Peter’s triple confession of love for his Savior: “Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love Thee” (John 21: 15-17). There are three stanzas omitted.\n\nI LOVE THEE appeared with this hymn in 1805 in a collection of sacred songs known as Christian Harmony, or Songster’s companion. It was edited by Jeremiah Ingalls in New Hampshire, and contained several secular and lively folk tunes set to sacred words. Ingalls was born on March 1, 1764, at Andover, Maine, and was in turn farmer, cooper, tavern keeper, and singing teacher. He settled in Newbury, Vermont, and was a deacon and choir director of the Congregational church there. H died at Hancock, Vermont, on April 16,1828. He also composed SDAH 533, NORTHFIELD. I LOVE THEE is an early American folk song brought from Europe by the first settlers. It is in the pentatonic scale and can be played entirely on the black notes of the piano if raised a minor third into the key of G-flat. Since the time is a mixture 3/4 and 4/4, the committee elected to leave the time signature.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "This hymn was first printed in John Bowring’s Hymns: as a Sequel to the Matins, 1825, and is based on Galatians 6:14: “God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.” There are five stanzas in the original, the omitted fifth being identical with the first. Bowring was born in Heavitree, Exeter, Devonshire, on October 17, 1792, the son of a manufacturer of woolen goods. In the course of his father’s business, he learned six languages by the time he was 16 years old, as sales were made to many different parts of the world. Ultimately he was reputed to be able to converse in 100 languages, and he published translations from 22. He was the editor of the Westminster Review from 1825 to 1831 but sought a political career. He was Commissioner to France for the British government in 1834—1835 and a member of Parliament from 1835 to 1849. He was British consul at Canton in 1849 and governor of Hong Kong in 1854, which discounts the story  Fatima in Macao. He probably did see the cross, but only 24 years after he had written the hymn. Bowring was knighted in 1854 and died at Claremont, on November 23, 1872. He also wrote SDAH 592, “Watchman, Tell Us of the Night.” He wrote more than 100 hymns—-most of them appearing in Unitarian hymnals, as he was a member of that faith—and 36 volumes on history, travel, biography, poetry, and religion.\n\nRATHBUN was composed in 1849 by Ithamar Conkey and named in honor of Mrs. Beriah S. Rathbun, who was leading soprano oh his choir in the Central Baptist Church in Norwich, Connecticut. It was inspired by his pastor’s sermon on “The Words on the Cross” and also by Bowring’s hymn, which was set to a tune that was not very popular with his choir. The tune first appeared in Henry Greattorex’s (see SDAH 48) Collection of Psalm and Hymn Tunes, 1851.\n\nConkey was born in Shutesbury, Massachusetts, on May 5, 1815. He was a bass soloist, choir conductor, and organist in Calvary Episcopal Church, and in 1861 soloist and conductor of the Madison Avenue Baptist Church. He died on April 30, 1867, at Elizabeth, New Jersey.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "historicalContext": "This hymn is one of the 280 hymns written by John Newton (1725-1807; see Biographies) for the Olney Hymns, 1779. It is  entitled “Solomon’s Song, The Name of Jesus.” It is based on chapter 1,  verse 3, of this poetic biblical book and contains seven stanzas.\n\nST. PETER was composed 1836 by Alexander Robert Reinagle and commemorates the church of St. Peter-in-the-East, Oxford, where he was organist from 1822 to 1856. Reinagle was of Austrian descent but born in Brighton, England, on August 21 1799. Both Reinagle’s father and grandfather were very musical, and he himself was a noted cellist and teacher of organ. He wrote instruction books for the violin and the cello. He died at Kidlington, a few miles north of Oxford, on April 6, 1877. The church where he was organist for so many years is now the library of St. Edmunds College, Oxford.\n\nST. PETER was composed particularly for a setting of Psalm 118 and appears in Reinagle’s Psalm Tunes for the Voice and the Pianoforte, c 1836. It was named ST. PETER in his collection of Psalm and Hymn Tunes, 1840. The soprano part is noteworthy for a descent of one complete octave, with some repeated notes, in the first two lines of the melody.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Three of the four people involved in this beautiful, intensely personal hymn of love for Christ carry the name “Johann” or John! It first appeared with this melody in Johann Cruger’s Praxis Pietatis Melica, Frankfurt, 1653. Apparently it was patterned after a love song, “Flora Meine Freude; Meiner Seelenweide” (Flora, My Joy, Food Of My Soul), in H. Alberti’s book Arien, 1641. When it begun to achieve popularity, many of the more conservative Lutherans in Germany felt it was much too personal for use in the corporate worship of the church. But it continued to gain favor and was translated into Estonian in 1667; into Russianin 1724, at the command of Peter the Great; and into Latin. There were six stanzas.\n\nCatherine Winkworth (1827-1878; see Biographies) wrote, “This is one of his most celebrated hymns, but from its peculiar meter it loses much in translation.” The meter actually is 6.6.5.6.6.5.3.4.8.6., thus making it a 10-line stanza, as lines 7 and 8 rhyme, e.g., am—Lamb, hell—fell, and whate’er—bear.\n\nJohann Franck was born June 1, 1618, at Guben, Germany, and studied law at the University of Konigsburg, the only German university left undisturbed by the Thirty Years’ War.  After two years, he returned home to be with his mother during the times of suffering in Guben brought on by the presence of both Swedish Saxon troops. He spent 32 years as a lawyer, town burgees, and councilor. John Julian says, “As hymn writer he holds a high rank and is distinguished for unfeigned and firm faith, deep earnestness, finished form, and noble, pithy simplicity of expression”. In his “Jesus, Priceless Treasure” we noticed a longing for the inward and mystical union of Christ with the soul.” One hundred ten of his hymns psalm versions were collected in his Gesitliches Sion, Guben, 1674. He died at Guben on June 18, 1677.\n\nA number of English translations have been made; this one by Catherine Winkworth was included in her Chorale Book Of England, 1863, and Christians Singers of Germany, 1869. When Cruger printed JESU, MEINE FREUDE (Jesus, My Joy) in Praxis Pietatis Melica (The Practice of Musical Piety) mentioned above, he marked it “traditional melody”. But he can almost certainly be given credit for altering it into hymn form. Johann Cruger was born April 9, 1598, at Gross-Breese (near Franck’s hometown), Germany. He attended a “poet’s school” at Regensburg, where he also studied music under Homberger, a pupil of the famous Gabrieli of Venice. After theological study at the university of Wittenburg and work as a private tutor in Berlin, he became cantor of St. Nicholas’ Church, Berlin, and a teacher in the Gymnasium of the Grey Cloister, position he held for 42 years until his death on February 23, 1662. He was one of the most distinguished musician of his time, but his main claim to fame is Praxis Pietatis Melica, a book of high quality hymn and tunes he collected and published, which became the chief source of tunes for later Lutheran hymnals. Julian regarded it as “the most important work of the century.” Revised and enlarged many times for nearly a hundred years, the final edition has more than 1,300 hymns. His other tunes in SDAH are No. 267, GRAFENBERG, and No. 559, NUN DANKET.\n\nA favorite melody of J. S. Bach (1685-1750; see Biographies), he used it Cantatas 12, 64, 81, and 87, as well as four organ works found in Orgelbucklein and in Miscellaneous Preludes. The SDAH version is as he harmonized it for the first chorale of his motet “Jesu, Meine Freude,” which was composed in 1723 especially for the funeral service of Frau Kase, wife of the postmaster at Leipzig. The Fourth-Part Chorales of J. S. Bach by Charles Sanford Terry (Oxford University Press), contains four harmonization of this tune.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "These words are a translation of a German hymn appearing in a manuscript dated 1662 from Munster, Germany, and were printed as a new hymn in 1677 in the Roman Catholic Munster Gesangbuch (hymnbook). It was entitled “Schonster Herr Jesu, herrscher aller Erden” (Most Beautiful Lord Jesus, Ruler of all the Earth). There have been several translations; this one, by Joseph August Seiss, formerly Seuss was published in the Sunday School Book for the use of Evangelical Lutheran Congregations, 1873.\n\nCRUSADER’S HYMN is a Silesian folk song discovered in 1836 by Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben (1798-1874), who with his friend Ernst Friedrich Richter (1808-1879), director of the church school  of St. Thomas in Leipzig, collected country songs. They heard it sung by haymakers in the Glatz district of Silesia in the summer of 1836 and jotted down  the music, which appeared with the words  of this hymn in Schlesische Volkslieder (Silesian Folksongs) in 1842. It was harmonized by Richard Storrs Willis (1819-1900; see SDAH 130) and published in 1850 in Church Chorales and Choir Studies. It is named CRUSADER’S HYMN because of a mistaken idea that it was sung by crudasers in the twelfth century as they made their way to the Holy Land. The association has been perpetuated by its use by Franz Liszt in his oratorio The Legend of St. Elizabeth, 1862, for part of the “Crusaders’ March.” Willis also composed tune SDAH 130, CAROL. Seiss was born at Graceham, Maryland, on March 18, 1823, and was confirmed as a Moravian at the age of 16. He wanted to study for the ministry but was discouraged by both his Moravian father and his bishop. However, he studied theology with his Moravian pastor and in 1839 attended the Pennsylvania College in Gettysburg, studying mainly in private. He was licensed to preach by the Lutheran Synod in 1842 and served in Virginia from 1847 to 1858, then in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from 1858 to 1874. With some of the members of his church he established the Church of the Holy Communion in Philadelphia. He was prolific editor of theological works, hymn collections and Lutheran liturgy. He died in Philadelphia on June 20, 1904.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "historicalContext": "Bernard of Clairvaux (1091-1153; see SDAH 156) wrote a long poem of about 48 stanzas entitled “Jesu, dulcis memoria” (“Jesus, Sweet Memory), probably after the disastrous Second Crusade, which he fostered, and during his retirement in about 1150. It is now known as the “Joyful, or Jubilee, Rhythm of St. Bernard on the Name of Jesus.” There have been many translations of this hymn (for example, SDAH 242), this one by Edward Caswall (1814-1878; see SDAH 43.) Bernard also wrote hymns SDAH 156, “O Sacred Head Now Wounded” and 242, “Jesus Thou Joy of loving Hearts.” Caswall also translated hymn SDAH 43,” When Morning Gilds the Skies.”\n\nCaswall’s translation is entitled “St. Bernards’ Hymn; or, The Loving Soul’s Jubilation.” The original hymn has five parts, and each part ranges from 9 to 11 four-line stanzas. The SDAH hymn consist of the first four stanzas of Part I plus the last or tenth stanza of Part IV except that the very last line originally was “My Hope, my victory.”\n\nST. AGNES, also used for SDAH 269, “Come, Holy Spirit,” and SDAH 655, “Happy the Home,” was composed in 1866 by John Bacchus Dykes (1823-1876; see Biographies), especially for these words. The name commemorates a young Roman girl, Agnes, who was martyred for her faith at the tender age of 13 in A.D. 304 under the persecution of Diocletian. She had refused to be married to a Roman nobleman because she had given her heart to the Lord Jesus; her dying words could well have been the sentiment of this hymn.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Bernard of Clairvaux (1091-1153; see SDAH  156) is credited with a hymn of about 48 stanzas entitled, ”Jesu, dulcis memoria” (Jesus, Sweet Memory), known as the “Jubilee Rhythm of the Name of Jesus” (see SDAH  241). Several translations of this hymn have been made from the original Latin, this one being by Ray Palmer in 1858 in his Sabbath Day Hymn Book. Bernard of Clairvaux also wrote the originals of SDAH 156, “O Sacred Head Now Wounded,” and SDAH 241, “Jesus the Very Thought of Thee.” Palmer also wrote SDAH 517, “My Faith   Looks Up to Thee.\n\nRay Palmer was born at Little Compton, Rhode Island, on November 12, 1808. He went to Boston and worked as a clerk in dry goods store and joined the Congregational Church. He spent 3 years at Phillip Academy in Andover before going to Yale University, where he graduated in 1830. After studying for the ministry, he was ordained in 1835, being appointed to the Central Congregational Church in Bath, Maine. In 1850 he was transferred to the First Congregational Church in Albany, New York, and in 1865 was appointed secretary of the American Congregational Union in New York City. He retired in 1878 to Newark, New Jersey, where he died on March 29, 1887.  He wrote several books on religious topics and doctrine, including Hymns and Sacred Pieces, 1865; Hymns of My Holy Hours, 1868; and Poetical Works, 1876.\n\nABENDS (At Evening) was composed in 1874 by Herbert Stanley Oakeley within a short space of half an hour; nit is so named because it was composed specially for the evening hymn “Sun of My Soul” (SDAH 502). Oakeley felt that the tune in use, HURSELEY, was inappropriate because it very closely resembled a popular German drinking song. Each one of the four parts of ABENDS is interesting, carrying a melody of its own, a somewhat rare occurrence in four-part hymnody. Oakeley was born in Ealing, Middlesex, on July 22,1830. He was professor of music at Edinburgh University from 1865-1891, and was knighted in 1876 for his outstanding services to church music. He died in Eastbourne, Sussex, on October 26, 1903.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "historicalContext": "The author and the composer of this hymn lived more than 200 years apart; they both died at a young age, one at 40, the other at 43. George Herbert (1593-1633; see SDAH 9), an Anglican minister, wrote a collection of poems published as The Temple. Three weeks before his death, he gave the manuscript to Nicholas Ferrar, requesting that he read it “and then, if he can think it may turn to the advantage of any dejected soul, let it be made public.” Herbert really had no idea of it being made into hymns, the whole being meant for meditation.\n\nAfter publication in 1633, The Temple was very popular; the first hymns from it were published in London, 1697. John and Charles Wesley took note of Herbert’s poetic quality, and included 40 hymns from The temple in their Hymns and Sacred Poems,1739. Herbert’s lyrics have been characterized as “quaint,” and the irregular meter of some have militated against their widespread use by congregations. He was a musician, and sang his own songs to the lute or a viol.\n\nTwo other hymns from The Temple in SDAH are No. 9, “Let All the World in Every Corner Sing,” and No. 247,” Come, My Way.”\n\nGWALCHMAI, named after a Welsh bard who lived in the twelfth century, is one of those distinctive, enthusiastic Welsh tunes that, because of their simplicity of form, almost sing themselves. GWALCHMAI was first published in Llyfr Tonau ac Emynau,1868, of which Jones was a coeditor.\n\nJoseph David Jones was born 1827 at Brynerugog, Montgomery, Wales. When he was 20, some of his psalm tunes were published, and with the money from their sale he went to London and studied music. For nine years he taught music in the British School at Ruthin, Denbigshire, Wales, and died there September 17, 1870. His works include cantata, The Court of Arthur, a book for singers, and a number of books of Welsh melodies.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Anny Jane Crosby (1820-1915; see Biographies), the most prolific writer of gospel songs who ever lived, collaborated with a number of the best-known composers of her time who worked in that idiom. Ira D. Sankey (see Biographies) published this one in his Sacred Songs and Solos, 1875. However, it was not picked by many later hymnals, appearing in only 11 books to 1950, and none since then. In 1973, when Donald P. Hustad was doing his editorial work for Hope Publishing Company’s Hymns for the Living Church, he asked E. Margaret Clarkson (1915-; see SDAH 578) to revise this hymn for use in that book, and SDAH has used her version also.\n\nIn 1977, Hustad edited, and Hope Publishing Company published, a significant little book for all those who appreciate Fanny Crosby’s poetic gift. Fanny Crosby Speaks Again, 120 heretofore unpublished manuscripts of her poems, with several photographs and letters. About that time Clarkson visited the offices of this company in Carol Stream, Illinois, and spent an hour looking through these manuscripts. This was her reaction:\n\n“Thank you for giving me the beautiful experience of an hour wit fanny J. Crosby!… When my hour or so was finished, I felt richly blessed. I had been in the presence of a great spirit, a saint of God. The things for which she praised God, I too praise Him. The struggles she knew, I know today. The glory of the heavenly home that blessed her way still beckons me on and blesses mine. I wonder if anyone reading my works a hundred years from now will ever so identify me with God’s pilgrims as her works identify her?\n\n“And to think that with all that colorful, descriptive language, Fanny Crosby had never seen what she so vividly described of earth’s beauties. How surprising. I think she looked on the face of God.”\n\nFor comments on NYLAND see SDAH 67.

    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "These words are from a poem by George Herbert (1593-1633; see SDAH 9), which was not intended as a hymn. It was first published under the title “The Call” in posthumous collection of his writings, The Temple, 1633 (see SDAH 243). It was included in the British hymnal Songs of Praise, Oxford,1925 and chosen by Ralph Vaughan Williams for one of his Mystical Songs. The first section of this solo song, although not very easy for congregational singing, has been used with this text in a number of hymnals.\n\nVaughan Williams’ characterization of “mystical” should not keep us from enjoying this well -constructed poem, which is mostly monosyllabic and aptly describesour relationship with Christ with nine words: Way, Truth, Life, Light, Feast, Strength, Joy, Love, and Heart.\n\nErik Routley, in Companion to Westminster Praise, has suggested that the second stanza line “Such a Feast, as mends in length” means Such a Feast as gets better and better as it goes on,” and “such a strength, as makes His guest “means” Such a Strength as communicates itself to His guest.” Most hymnologists agree that the best hymns do not need explanation. But once in a while it is good for us to look closely at a line of poetry, think about what the poet had in mind, and in this way find a new meaning and application to our present life. Herbert also wrote SDAH 9, “Let All the World in Every Corner Sing,” and SDAH 243, “King of Glory, King of Peace.”\n\nAlexander Brent-Smith was born October 8, 1889, at Brookthorpe, near Gloucester, England. After a time as an assistant at Worcester Cathedral, he went in 1913 to Lancing College as a director of music (following William H. Ferguson; see SDAH 360), staying until 1934. From then until his death July 3, 1950, at the age 60, he devoted his time to writing, speaking, music composition, and the activities of the Gloucester Music Club. He was an expert on the symphonies and chamber music of Schubert, and wrote articles for The Musical Times. His compositions include Ode to the Nativity, Paradise Songs, Concertos for two violins and two pianos, and an Elegy composed for the Three Choirs Festival of 1939. (because that event was canceled, it was not performed until 1946.) Four of his hymn tunes can be found in current hymnals: COTSWOLD; ANTIPHON; LANCING, and COME, MY WAY, also known as THE CALL.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Frederick Whitefield wrote the words of these stanzas in 1855 under the title “. The Name Of Jesus.” It appeared with 25 more of his original hymns in Sacred Poems and Prose, 1861. There were nine stanzas. As a hymn text it was published twice in 1864, in Goodman’s Village Hymn Book, Taunton, Massachusetts, and Bradbury’s Devotional Hymn and Tune Book, Philadelphia.\n\nFrederick Whitfield was born January 7 1829, at Threapwood, a village in Shropshire, He trained at Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland, graduating with a B.A. in 1859, and was ordained in the Anglican Church. He was appointed curate to Otley, Yorkshire; then to Kirkby-Ravensworth, a village in north Yorkshire; then to Greenwich, on the south bank of the Thames River in east London. He was appointed vicar at Bexley in Kent, east of Greenwich; then to Hastings, Sussex. He wrote more than 30 books of prose and verse. Death came September 13, 1904, at Lower Norwood, Croydon, London. Whitfield also wrote SDAH 484, “I Need Thee, Precious Jesus.”\n\nThe refrain was not a part of the original hymn, but added to several “mother” hymns, including Newton’s “Amazing Grace,” Watts’s “Alas, and Did My Savior Bleed,” and other common meter hymns. Ellen Jane Lorenz, in her Glory, Hallelujah! The Story of the Campmeeting Spiritual, says that she found this favorite refrain attached to various mother-hymns 42 times, the earliest being dated 1868. The example she gives from The Revivalist, 1872, has a simpler final phrase, without the slur on the word because. The whole world tune is typical of the folklike camp meetings song in the nineteenth-century America that were in 6/8 time, had a natural easy movement, were a joy to sing and instantly memorable.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

Some alterations have been made as there was originally no refrain, and the last two lines of stanza I were:\n\nO ye saints that dwell on the mountains of Zion,\nPraise Him! Praise Him, ever in joyful song.\n\nThe tune was composed by Chester G. Allen (1838-1877) especially for these words. It is sometimes named JOYFUL SONG, which reechoes the last words of the refrain. The hymn first appeared in Bright Jewels, 1869. Allen was a teacher of singing in New York and a conductor of singing at conventions. He also contributed to several compilations of Sunday School songs.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "Charles Wesley (1707-1788; see Biographies) underwent a great spiritual change on May 21, 1738; he dated his real conversion from this experience. On the first anniversary of his conversion, and inspired by his Moravian friend Peter Bohler’s remark, “Had I a thousand tongues, I would praise Jesus Christ with them all,” Wesley burst forth in this rapturous poem of 18 stanzas. His title was “For the Anniversary Day of One’s Conversion.” The first six stanzas, now omitted, show the very personal nature of Wesley’s experience. Then followed the six stanzas SDAH uses, and five others addressed respectively to nations, harlots, thieves, and murderers, concluding with:\n\n18. With me, your chief, you then shall know,\nShall feel your sins forgiven; \nAnticipate your heaven below, \nAnd own that love in heaven.\n\nFor his 1780 Collection of Hymns for the Use of the People Called Methodist, John Wesley began the hymn with SDAH’s stanza 1 and established the practice, observed in all Methodist hymnals except the one published in 1935, of making this No. 1 hymn. So we can safely call it the foremost hymn of Methodism.\n\nThe tune AZMON, an old Testament name meaning “bonelike” and having no particular significance, was picked up by Lowell Mason (1792- 1872; see Biographies) on one of his trips to Europe, and first printed in his Modern Psalmist, 1839. It was originally in 4/4 time but has also been used in 6/8,3/4, and 3/2, as SDAH has it. Carl Gotthilf Glaser was born May 4, 1784, in Wessenfels, Germany, 20 miles east of Leipzig. In that city he became a chorister at St. Thomas’ Church, where J.S Bach (see Biographies) had earlier served as master musician. At first Glaser studied law at the University of Leipzig, but he then turned to music, becoming a teacher of violin, piano, and voice. He also was a choir director and operated a music shop. Besides being a music publisher, he composed motets, instrumental music, and school songs. He died at Barmen, Germany, April16, 1829.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "historicalContext": "George Sanville, who for many years was on thestaff of the Rodeheaver Company, in his Forty Gospel Hymn Stories, 1943, gives this account of writing of this gospel hymn. A young Jewish man had attended the evening evangelistic service of A.H. Ackley for five or six successive nights. One night he remained at the close of the service for further information about the divine presence of Jesus. “Why should I worship a dead Jew?” he asked. Ackley forthrightly answered, “He lives! I tell you, He is not dead, but lives here and now! Jesus Christ is alive today. I can prove it by my own experience, as well as the testimony of countless thousands.” In his rereading of the Resurrection stories of the Gospels, the words in in Matthew 28:6, “He is not her: for he is risen,” struck him with new meaning. Ackley said, “The thought of His ever-living presence brought the words and music promptly and easily.”\n\nThe Rodeheaver Company included this song in Triumphant Service Songs,1933, and it has since traveled widely over the world.\n\nAlfred Henry Ackley was born January 21, 1887, at Spring Hill Pennsylvania. He learned music as a child from his father, and later studied in New York City and at Westminster Theological Seminary in Maryland. After ordination to the Presbyterian ministry, he served as a pastor in Pennsylvania and California. For a time, he was assistant to Hugh Thompson Kerr, editor of the Presbyterian Hymnal,1933. He and his older brother, B.D. Ackley (see SDAH 311), were very prolific in writing words and music of more than 1,000 hymns and gospel songs. They both worked for the Rodeheaver Company in compiling and publishing songbooks. Alfred received the honorary D. Sac. Mus. degree from John Brown University. He died at Whittier, California, July 3, 1960,\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "historicalContext": "James Montgomery (1771-1854; see Biographies) wrote this hymn in 1841; it was printed in the Sunday School Teacher’s Magazine as one of the “original hymns for the Sheffield Sunday School Union Festival, Whitsunday, May 31, 1841.” It appears as hymn No. 89 in his Original Hymns, with seven stanzas.\n\nThe first stanza has been changed because of the original second line, and accordingly the fourth line because of the rhyme; the alternation now makes each stanza end with the fourth line because of the rhyme; the alteration now makes each stanza end with the same attribution of praise to the Lamb. The original was:\n\nCome, let us sing the songs- \nThe song which saints in glory sing;\nThe homage which to Christ belongs:\nToday let babes and suckling bring.\n\nThe Last stanza has also been changed, presumably because of a possible doctrinal misunderstanding. The hymn is a paraphrase of the triumphant heavenly chorus narrated in Revelation 5:9-13.\n\nThe tune RUSSIA, or ST. PETERSBURG to avoid confusing it with the former Russian National Anthem or RUSSIAN HYMN (see SDAH 84), is an adaptation of a tune composed in 1825 by Dimitri Stepanovitch Bortnianski. This tune of six lines, where lines 3 and 4 are a repetition of the first two lines, has had lines 3 and 4 omitted, thus becoming a standard Long Meter tune.\n\nBortnianski was born October 28,1972, in the Ukraine. As a boy he was trained in voice at St. Petersburg (which became Petrograd in 1914 and Leningrad in 1924). Then Catherine the Great had him further trained in Italy, where he stayed until 1779, returning to become director of the Empress Catherine’s choir. He wrote church music for the choir, and also composed operas and pieces for instrumental music. He died on October 10, 1825, at St. Petersburg.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "historicalContext": "The theme for this hymn was suggested to William Hunter by a railway accident in which there were a large number of fatalities. However, the presence of several medical men on the train reduced the number of casualties, and the spiritual lesson is drawn in these words. Under the title “Christ the Physician,” the eight -stanza hymn appeared in Hunter’s Song of Devotion, 1859. While Jesus is first introduced as the Great Physician, the emphasis throughout is on the name of Jesus, which means Savior. A suitable text summarizing the hymn would be: “There is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved” (Acts 4:12).\n\nWilliam Hunter was born May 26, 1811, in Antrim Country, Ireland. While he was still a child, his parents move to York, Pennsylvania. After graduating from Madison College, Uniontown, Pennsylvania, he spent several years teaching and preaching before beginning his work as an editor, working for some 16 years for the Pittsburgh Conference Journal and its successor, Christian Advocate. Beginning in the 1855 he taught Hebrew and Biblical literature at Allegheny College. The author of more than 125 Hymns, he complied Minstrel of Zion, 1845; Select Melodies, 1851, which included this hymn; and Songs of Devotions, 1859. In 1876 he was appointed one of a committee of 12 by the General Conference of the Methodist Church to make a revision of the hymnal, which was published in 1878 as the Hymnal of the Methodist Episcopal Church. During intervals between his preaching and editing, he was presiding elder and pastor in the west Virginia Conference, concluding his his ministry as pastor in Alliance Ohio, where he died on October 18, 1877. Hunter also wrote SDAH 437, “I’m Going Home”.\n\nThe tune was specially written for the text by John Hart Stockton. It is in the form AABA, the first two and the fourth scores being the same.\n\nStockton was born on April 19, 1813, at New Hope, Pennsylvania, in a Presbyterian home, but was converted at a Methodist camp meeting. He became a Methodist minister, pastoring in turn several churches in the New Jersey Conference. He died at Philadelphia on march 25, 1877. He published two volumes of gospel songs, Salvation Melodies, 1874, and Precious Songs, 1875. He also contributed both words and music of SDAH 279,” Only trust Him,” to a ten-unnamed tune.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "This is a hymn of four eight-line stanza, each of which is divided into two parts. The first four lines express amazement and wonder at the “why” and “how” of Jesus’ coming to earth from heaven; the final four lines form an affirmation of faith in the success of Jesus’ rescue mission — in spite of our lack of understanding of the mystery.\n\nWilliam Young Fullerton was born March 8, 1857, in Belfast, Ireland, and reared a Presbyterian. Moving to London in 1875, he attended the Metropolitan Tabernacle, where the great Charles Spurgeon was the preacher, and became a Baptist. Answering a call to the ministry, he attended Pastor’s College now Spurgeon’s College) and held evangelistic campaigns in Britain for 15 years before the settling down to be a pastor at Melbourne Hall, Leicester. At various times he held several important positions in the church, and recognized as one of the most prominent Baptist personages of his time in Britain. He wrote a biography of Spurgeon, and devotional and expository books. He died at Bedford Park, Middlesex, on August 17, 1932.\n\nLONDONDERRY AIR is familiar to nearly everyone as an Irish folk song. It has been arranged and sung to different sets of words countless times. A.P. Graves used it with two Irish songs, “Erin’s Farewell” and “Erin’s Apple Blossom.” Perhaps the most well-known in America is “Danny Boy,” written by F.E. Weatherly in 1912. The natural flowing beauty of the tune; its overall style, which is in keeping with a sacred atmosphere; and the way the words and music fit so well together, furnish the reasons this hymn was chosen by the SDAH Committee.\n\nJohn Barnard, the arranger of this tune, was born April 20, 1948, and educated in England, becoming organist and choirmaster at Emmanuel Church, Northwood, Middlesex, England, and a Fellow of the Royal College of Organist. His main occupation, however, is that of teacher of French and German at the John Lyon School, Harrow.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "The year 1744 was a time of great political unrest in England because of the war with France and the effort to reestablish the House of Stuart. Many Roman Catholic Jacobites and sympathizers with Charles Edward, the Young Pretender, were at work throughout the country, and the new groups of Methodists formed by the Wesley brothers were often falsely accused of being papist in disguise. Their meetings were often broken up by hooligans, and both preachers and congregation were pelted with rotten eggs, cabbages, and bricks. Many were arrested and brought before the magistrates as disturbers of the peace, but this persecution failed to daunt them. For their encouragement Charles Wesley (1707-1788; see Biographies) wrote several hymns under the title Hymns for Times of Trouble and Persecution. This particular one had the instruction: “To be sung in a tumult”; it first appeared anonymously in 1744. There were 17 stanzas in all, six in Part I, seven in Part II, and four in Part III. SDAH has stanza 1, 4, 5, and 6 pf Part I.\n\nHANOVER was composed in 1708 by William Croft (1678-1727; see SDAH 103), and first appeared in Tate and Brady’s New Version under the title “A New Tune to the 149th Psalm of the New Version and the 104th of the Old.” It was one of the early departures from the common 4/4 style of singing to a new triple time. It was named BROMSWICK by John Wesley in 1742, but is now known as HANOVER in honor of the accession of George III of Hanover to the throne of England. Croft also composed ST. ANNE, SDAH 103.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "historicalContext": "There were stanzas in the original poem by Bianco, the first one beginning “Descendi, amor santo,” meaning Descend, holy love.” It was included in Laudi Spirituali, a collection of hymns in the vernacular (Italian) language (as opposed to the Latin used in the Catholic service), written by Bianco but not published until some 400 years later. The hymns were sung by people known as “Laudisti”, Italian congregations in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries who cultivated congregational singing of these simple hymns of praise and devotion in their own language. This hymn was first published by Telesforo Bini at Luca, Italy, in 1851; the translation in English was published in the People’s Hymnal, 1867.\n\nBianco da Siena’s birthdate is unknown, but he was born September 14, 1833, in Dublin, Ireland, was virtually at the top of his class all the way through his education at Trinity College, Dublin. He received the B.A. degree in 1855, the M.A. in 1858, the LL.B. and LL.D. in 1862, and if that were not enough, the Doctor of Civil Law from Oxford, also in 1862. Along the way he became a University Scholar First Class, gold medalist in classics, and gold medalist in Greek. Ordained in 1856, he served as pastor of two parishes for only about five years before ill health forced him to retire to less strenuous work. For the rest of his life he distinguished himself by writing 50 books on theology, history, the liturgy, and hymnology. One influential book was Plain Reasons Against Joining the Church of Rome, 1880. Besides writing original hymns, carol, and metrical litanies, he translated hymns into English From Danish, Swedish, Greek, Latin, Syriac, German, and Italian. He published Carols for Christmas and Other Seasons in 1863. He died in London January 11, 1890.\n\nDOWN AMPNEY is named after Vaughan Williams’ (1872-1958; see Biographies) place of birth, near Cirencester, Gloucester, England. He wrote it especially for this text to be in English Hymnal, 1906. At first it was marked “Anon”. He also marked the suggested tempo as “one quarter note equals 88,” which seems terribly slow to us now. Erik Routley characterizes this tune as “perhaps the most beautiful tune composed since OLD HUNDREDTH.” It is the universally accepted tune for this text.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "author": "Percy Dearmer",
    "authorBirthDeath": "1867–1936",
    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "Percy Dearmer was one of the giants of English hymnology, having an editorial hand in English Hymnal, 1906; Songs of Praise, 1925 and 1931; the Oxford Book of Carols, 1928; the Revised English Hymnal, 1933; and Songs of Praise Discussed, a handbook for the second-named hymnal, 1933. He carried a lifelong crusade for simplicity and sincerity to replace romantic pretentiousness, and called for a critical analysis of everything that is done in church music and worship—aiming for high standards of beauty and reality.\n\nBorn at Kilburn, London, February 27, 1867, he was educated at Christ Church, Oxford University, where he earned the B.A. in 1890 and the M.A. in 1896. Ordained a priest of the Church of England, he served in central London at St. Johns, Berkeley Chapel, and St. Mark’s where he worked with organist Martin Shaw (see SDAH 28). His D.D. degree came from Oxford in 1911. After a year as chaplain with the British forces in World War I, he became a lecturer for the YMCA, visiting India, Burma, and North America. In 1919 he was appointed professor of ecclesiastical art at King’s College, London, where he served until his death. In 1931 he was made canon and librarian of Westminster, and was steward of the Abbey for three years. He greatly enjoyed serving at this place so full of history and being a guide to groups of visitors.\n\nDermear’s concept of the taking of the bread and wine in the Communion service perplexed and troubled many of his friends, for he saw it in a wider perspective than most. He looked forward to the reconstitution of society on the basis of Christ’s love and self-sacrifice. The service commemorating the Lord’s Supper meant for him the gathering of neighbors in a friendly meal, filled with the sense of Jesus’ presence as the true leader of men. He cared intensely that such a meal should be surrounded by all that was beautiful in color, in music, in ceremony; but it was not as a substitute, but as a focus, for the common meals in which neighbors met to affirm their mutual love and their  mutual discipleship. He even came to feel that the present method of celebrating the Communion service made it an alternative to, and not a symbol of human fellowship. It might even be that some had made the Communion an excuse for not inviting someone home to supper, and thus the things that should have been a blessing had become an occasion for falling. He said that if the church failed to be an expression of human and divine love, then it was of little use to frequent its feast or to spend time and money clothing its functionaries. These views are summed up in stanza 3 of this hymn. Dreamer died May 29, 1936.\n\nThe tune was given the name UNION SEMINARY by Jet Turner, who, adapted it to congregational singing from an anthem by Harold Friedell that makes use of this text. Both Turner and Friedell were closely associated with the school of Sacred Music of Union Theological Seminary in New York. Turner was a graduate and Friedell a professor of theory and composition.\n\nHarold Friedell was born in 1905 in Jamaica, New York, and served as organist in several Episcopal churches in and around New York City. He taught theory and composition at the Guilmant Organ School, Juilliard School of Music, and the school of Sacred Music at Union Theological Seminary. A Fellow of the American Guild of Organists, he was awarded an honorary D.Mus. degree by Missouri Valley College. His compositions include hymn tunes, carols, service music, and choral anthems. He died of a heart attack February 17, 1958, at the age of 53, while walking through heavy snow from  his home at Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, to the railway station.\n\nJet E. Turner was born 1928 at Monrovia, California. He began organ study at age 7 and held his first organist job at age 14. A graduate of Pomona College in California, he studied further at Claremont College and earned his B.D. at Andover Newton Theological School. At Union Theological Seminary in New York he received the Master of Sacred Music, and finally the Doctor of Musical Arts in Organ Performance from the University of Wisconsin. He served in positions of music leadership for churches of several denominations in Pasadena, California; Westfield, New Jersey; Newton Center, Massachusettes; Keene, New Hampshire; Peoria; Illinois (where he taught at Bradley University); Madison, Wisconsin; Alexandria, Louisiana (also chairman of the music department of Louisiana College). His final post was at First Presbyterian Church, San Diego, California. In 1984, according to reports, he was killed in his own home by an intruder. Turner was a consultant on organ design for several churches and was on the editorial board for the Christian Worship hymnal published by the American Baptist Church. He was the founding president of the Fellowship of American Baptist Musician and served as dean of the Conference for Church Musicians, which is held each summer at the American Baptist Assembly, Green Lake, Wisconsin. As a member of the Baptist-Disciples hymnbook committee, Turner was chairman of the tunes and service music subcommittee.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

Later Briggs revised it for Songs of Faith, 1945, where it carried the title “The Spirit of Wisdom.”\n\nGeorge Wallace Briggs was born December 14, 1875, at Kirkby, Nottinghamshire, England, and was a scholar of Emmanuel College, Cambridge. After ordination as an Anglican priest, he served in the Royal Navy as a chaplain for seven years. He pastored two churches from 1909 to 1927; then he was appointed canon of Leicester Cathedral,1927-1934, and canon of Worcester Cathedral, 1934-1956. He assisted in editing several hymnals, including, with Percy Dearmer (see SDAH 259), Song of Praise,1931. One of the founders of the Hymn Society of Great Britain and Ireland, in 1957 he produced Hymns of the Faith for his Worcester Cathedral. One of his main concerns was to provide quality hymns to be sung by students in the schools. He died at Hindhead, Surrey, December 30, 1959.\n\nThe musical editor of the English Hymnal, 1906, Ralph Vaughan Williams (see Biographies), wedded this tune SOLLS SEIN to “The Summer Days Are Come Again,” by Samuel Longfellow, He found the melody in the book Drei schone neue geistliche Leider (Three Beautiful New Spiritual Songs), Munich, 1637. It was later included in D.G. Corner’s Geistliche Nachtigal (Sacred Nightingale), 1658. Erik Routley first matched the tune with these words of Canon Brigg’s in Congregational Praise, 1953. The arrangement printed there is the one SDAH uses, but with the note values halved, half notes becoming quarter notes.\n\nDavid Gregor Corner was born in 1585 at Hirschberg, Silesia, and studied at the University of Prague. Ordained a Catholic priest in 1614, he served churches at Rotz and Mautern; in 1625 he entered the Benedictine monastery at Gotweig, becoming its abbot in 1631. He was responsible for a Catholic hymnal, Gross Catholiches Gesangbuch (Great Catholic Hymnal, 1625), which enjoyed seven printings up to 1676. In 1638 he became rector of the University of Vienna, where he had received an honorary doctorate of theology in 1614. He died in Gottweig, January 9, 1648.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "historicalContext": "This beautifully structured hymn was written in April 1947 by Albert Frederick Bayly (1901-1984; see Biographies). It is virtually a paraphrase of various scriptures describing the action of God penetrating human hearts.\n\nSONG 13 is from George Wither’s Hymns and Songs of the Church, 1623, a book that was unique for its time because it was not a psalter. All of Gibbons’ tune were in this one book, and each of them was originally written in two parts. In Wither’s book, which was never published because it contained unauthorized hymns, each tune was named after a particular “song” or text to which it should be sung, according to their number. This one was for the thirteenth song, which had stanzas of six lines, but the melody for the last two pairs of lines was repeated so the tune is equally suitable as a four-line melody.  Also called CANTERBURY for the place of Gibbons’ death, it is used again at SDAH 374 for “Jesus, With Thy Church Abide.”\n\nOrlando Gibbons was baptized Christmas Day, 1583, at St. Martin’s Church, Oxford. His father was one of the town musicians.  Orlando was in Kings’ College Choir, Cambridge, at age 13, and in 1605 became organist of the Chapel Royal. He held that position for the rest of his life (20 years). He received the B.Mus. from Cambridge in 1606, and in 1622 the honorary D.Mus. was conferred upon him by the University of Oxford. Becoming organist at Westminster Abbey in 1623, he conducted of music for the funeral of King James I. Unfortunately, he fell ill and died at Canterbury Cathedral, June 5, 1625, at the early age of 42, and was buried there. His compositions include anthems, several services for worship, and a wealth of polyphonic choral music. Somehow, his hymn tunes were not appreciated until Ralph Vaughan Williams (see Biographies) introduced them in the English Hymnal, 1906; this brought about their revival, which has lasted until the present time.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "On the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost filled the disciples and “there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as fire “(Acts 2:3). The Holy Spirit also filled the Old Testament prophets though not necessarily with same outward manifestation: “Holy men of God speak as they were moved by the Holy Ghost (2 Peter 1:21). Bathurst combined this idea of fire and the presence of the Spirit of God by picking out seven saints of old and including them in this hymn written in 1831. The hymn was first printed in Psalms and hymns for Public and Private Use, 1831.\n\nWilliam Hiley Bathurst was born August 28, 1796, at Clevedale, Mangotsfield, near Bristol. Son of a member of Parliament for Bristol, he graduated from Oxford University in 1818 with a B.A.  In 1820 he accepted an appointment as rector on his uncle’s estate at Barwick-in-Elmet, near Leeds, Yorkshire. He changed his name from Bragge to Bathurst, after his uncle, and occupied this position until1852. He objected to the doctrine of baptism and burial as set out in the Book of Common Prayer, resigned his position, and returned to the family estate at Gloucestershire, where he died November 25, 1877. He wrote several books, and more than 200 hymns, including SDAH 533,” O for a Faith.”\n\nMENDON, named for a village in Worcester County, Massachusetts, was arranged from a German melody in 1824 by Samuel Dyer, an Englishman who emigrated to the United States in 1811 and became a choirmaster and music teacher. Dyer organized sacred concerts in Philadelphia and in 1814 settled in Baltimore. The name of the tune was given by the compilers of the Methodist Harmonist, 1821. Note that the second and fourth phrases of the melody are almost identical.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "yearWritten": 1878,
    "historicalContext": "In a small booklet entitled “Between Doubt and Prayer,” printed privately in 1878, Edwin Hatch included his four-stanza hymn as one for ordination. The six words that begin each stanza recall the words of Jesus to His disciples when He appeared to them in the evening of the day of resurrection: “He breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost” (John 20:22). A slight change has been made in stanza 3, line 2, which originally read “Blend my soul with Thine.” Then for the theological reasons the fourth stanza, second line, has been altered from “So shall I never die” to “So shall I constant be,” which also makes a better rhyme! The hymn has proved quite popular after its first appearance in a hymn book in 1886. The Congregational Psalmist hymnal.\n\nHatch was born in Derby, England, on September 4, 1835, of Nonconformist parents. However, he enjoined the Church of England in 1853 and studied at Pembroke College, Oxford. He graduated in 1857 and in 1859 entered the ministry in the East End of London, where he stayed for three years. Then he was professor of classics at Trinity College, in Toronto, Canada, and later rector of a high school in Quebec. In 1867 he returned to England as vice principal of St. Mary’s Hall, Oxford. In 1880 he was Bampton lecturer, dealing with early church organization, and in 1883 became rector of Purleigh in Essex. In 1884 he became Reader in Ecclesiastical History at Oxford, which position he held until his death on November 10, 1889, at Headington, Oxford. He was a deeply religious profound scholar; the University of Edinburgh awarded him an honorary D.D. degree in 1883.\n\nPARACLETE was composed by Joseph Harker, who was born March 5, 1880, in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Northnumberland, England. He loved the deeply spiritual words of this hymn and wrote the tune to suit them in 1914. The name is a transliteration of the Greek word for the Comforter (john 14:16). Harker was a Seventh-day Adventist minister, a poet, and a musician. His talents were used in the preparation of the hymnbooks used in the British field, Advent Hymnal, 1915; The Advent Hymnal (revised), 1928; and The New Advent Hymnal, 1952. The first two of these were also the official hymnbooks for the African mission fields of the British Union, and in Australia and New Zealand. To the latter hymnal he contributed four complete hymns, text, and tune; 10 other hymn texts; and 16 other hymn tunes. To SDAH he also contributed No. 543, SIMONSIDE. He was a composer, choir conductor, organist, music editor, musician, and a poet, and also a youth leader and gospel minister, a Christian gentleman “who made earth happy with his songs of heaven.” He died in Reading, England, on May 11, 1970.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

Born August 17, 1780, in Dublin Ireland, he earned the M.A. degree from University of Dublin in 1804 and the Doctor of Laws in 1831. He entered the ministry, serving in Ireland until 1810, when he moved to London, where for 25 years he devoted his energies to writing poetry, drama, and novels. In 1835 he returned to the ministry in a united parish of two churches near Mansion House, and gained fame as a powerful, conservative preacher. In 1854 he published Psalms and Hymns for Public Worship, which had 10 psalm versions, 12 hymns, and 6 poems bearing his initial. He died while walking down the street in Holborn, London, November 24,1860.\n\nMORECAMBE is named after a favorite spot on Morecambee Bay, Lancashire, England, noted for the music festival held there. The composer was organist near there at the time of writing the tune. He wrote it especially for the text “Abide With Me,” and it was first printed in the 1887 Congregational Church Hymnal, London. Frederick Cook Atkinson was born August 21, 1841, at Norwich, England. As a boy, he was a choir singer at Zechariah Buck. After graduating from Cambridge in 1867, he served as organist-choirmaster at St. Luke’s Church, Manningham, Bradford; Norwich Cathedral; at St. Mary’s Church, Lewisham. He wrote songs, anthems, worship service music, hymn tunes, and piano pieces. He died at East Dereham, Norfolk, November 30, 1896. MORECAMBE is also used for SDAH 668, “O Thou Who Hearest.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "In early 1829 the London Board of Congregational ministers gathered for study and counsel. One of their recommendations was to set aside the coming Good Friday as a day of humiliation and prayer, that by the grace of God a revival of religion might be promoted in the churches of Great Britain. One of their number, Andrew Reed, wrote this hymn of seven stanzas as a prayer for himself and his fellow ministers, and it was sung on Good Friday. It was printed in the Evangelical Magazine, June 1829, entitled “Hymn to the Spirit,” and then in Reed’s Hymn Book, 1842. Reed also wrote SDAH 268, “Holy Spirit, Light Divine.”\n\nAndrew Reed was born on November 27, 1787, in London, the son of a watchmaker who was a Congregational lay preacher. He trained at Hackney College in 1807 for the Congregational ministry and was ordained in 1811. His first pastorate was at St. George’s-in-the-East, where he had been a member previously. His ministry was successful to the point that the increased congregation caused so much overcrowding that a new building, the Wycliffe Chapel, was built, where he ministered from 1831 until his retirement in 1861. Yale University honored him with a D.D. degree when he visited the United States in 1834. A great philanthropist, he was a major factor in founding an orphanage at Clapton, east London; another one in Croydon, south London; an asylum for idiots in Surrey; the Royal Hospital for Incurables in Surrey; another asylum for idiots in the Eastern Counties in the Essex; and yet another orphanage for infants at Wanstead, northeast London. Apart from the £100,000 he raised for these projects, a huge sum in those days, he actively supported missionary work. In 1817 he published a collection of hymns that contained 21 of his own. This was enlarged in 1825 and superseded in 1842. To SDAH he also contributed N0. 268, “Holy Spirit, Light Divine.” He died at Cambridge Health, Hackney, on February 25, 1862.\n\nGRÄFENBERG carries the name of a spa town about 30 miles southeast of Bayreuth in Bavaria, but with no association with the composer, Johann Crüger (1598-1662; see SDAH 239). The tune appears in his Praxis Pietatis Melica, 2nd edition, 1647, and also in the 1653 edition. Cruger also composed tunes for SDAH 239, JESU, MEINE FREUDE; and SDAH 559, NUN DANKET.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

It was written in 1817 and has eight lines in each stanza, the latter half of each being omitted in SDAH.\n\nIt is interesting to compare the structure of this hymn, which uses three metaphors for the Holy Spirit, with the previous hymn by the same author (SDAH 267), which uses three similes (five in the original with “dew” and “wind” added).\n\nMERCY has a cosmopolitan flavor, for it was composed in 1854 as a piano piece, “Last Hope,” by Louis Moreau Gottschalk. Gottschalk was born in America to a French mother and English father with a German name. The tuned is named MERCY because it was first associated with Charles Wesley’s “Depth of Mercy,” SDAH 521.\n\nGottschalk was born December 19, 1829, in New Orleans. He was a child prodigy, going to Paris to study at age 13. Chopin predicted that he would become the “king of pianist” and a world-recognized composer.  He wrote a large volume of popular piano pieces, a symphony, a cantata, two operas, and an overture. He died of yellow fever on December 18, 1869, while on a trip to Brazil, where he went to perform at a festival of his own music.\n\nEdwin Pond Parker was born January 13, 1836, at Castine, Maine.  He was educated at Bowdoin College and Bangor Theological Seminary, and became a congregational minister, serving at Hartford, Connecticut, for more than 50 years. He wrote some 200 hymns after the age of 56 and was the editor of several books of hymns. Parker died at Hartford, on May 28, 1925. He arranged MERCY as a hymn tune.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

His title was “Breathing After the Holy Spirit: or Fervency of Devotion Desired”; his hymn consisted of five stanzas, of which only 1 and 5 remain.\n\nThe metaphor of a dove is taken from the incident at the baptism of Jesus when “The Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him” (Matt. 3:16). The words of John the Baptist are also alluded to in Watts’s comparison of baptism by water and by the Spirit: “He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire” (Matt. 3:11).\n\nST. AGNES also used for SDAH 241, “Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee,” and SDAH 655, “Happy the Home,” was composed in 1866 by John Bacchus Dykes (1823-1876; see Biographies).

    "author": "Bryan Jeffery Leech",
    "authorBirthDeath": "1931–2015",
    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "This hymn about the work of the Holy Spirit has an unusual triple rhyming scheme, finishing its stanza with a five-word refrain: “Spirit, now live in me.” The author writes from his home in Santa Barbara, California: O Holy Dove’ was written in Fred Bock’s office [in Tarzana, California] when we were producing Hymns for the Family of God and was my attempt to write a hymn for Pentecost [a Christian festival on the seventh Sunday after Easter, commemorating the descent of the Holy Spirit on the apostles; also called Whitsunday]. The tune name, LOIS denotes that this hymn is dedicated to Fred’s wife, Lois Bock, herself a very talented woman with two books to her credit.”\n\nBryan Jeffery Leech was born May 14, 1931, in Buckhurst Hill, Essex, England, and educated in private schools in Yorkshire. After graduation from London Bible College in 1955, he attended Barrington College (Rhode Island) and North Park Seminary (Chicago), a denominational school for the Evangelical Covenant Church of America. An ordained minister for more than 30 years, he has served churches of that fellowship in Boston; Montclair, new Jersey; and San Francisco and Santa Barbara, California. In 1975 he left the parish ministry for a free-lance career and ministry as a writer, lyricist, composer, and broadcaster.\n\nLeech has written more than 200 songs, hymns, and anthems. He is the author of two books, It Must Have Been McNutt, and Lift My Spirit, Lord, Augsburg, 1984, and has just completed a book for children, John Jeremy Colton. He is the author, composer, and book writer for full-length musical play, Ebenezer (his version of Dicken’s Christmas Carol); Resurrection (the story of Peter); A Tale of Two Brothers (the prodigal son parable in musical drama), and Bethlehem (a Christmas play that deals with the problem of unanswered prayer). With Fred Bock, he edited Hymns for the Family of God, and also produced the companion volume to that service book and hymnal. Previously Leech was one of the editors of The Covenant Hymnal 1973. He has some 50 published anthems to his credit. His radio program, Morning Song, is broadcast on station in Santa Barbara and Oxnard, California, as well as on shortwave from HCJB, Quito, Ecuador. He also does what he calls “Holy Ghostwriting” for the Haven of Rest broadcast. Many denominations call upon him to speak at worship, conferences, and seminars.\n\nWhen asked for his philosophy of hymn writing, whether it be a song lyric or a piece of prose or a dramatic play, is that the first priority of the Christian writer is that of the authenticity and integrity in basing one’s material soundly on the Word of God. Having preached for more than 30 years, I now have a deep well from which to draw.\n\n“Next to faith, one must remind oneself that writing is a craft. God seldom gives me a song directly. Usually He uses His gifts to me of writing skills and experience of grace and of life, and out of these He enables me to fashion something of worth. If something succeeds, it is because He enabled me to do it. If something fails, my limitation came into play. So many Christians seem to want to avoid learning the basic skills, and to avoid the agonizing struggle of writing and rewriting and writing again.\n\n“Thirdly, learning to write takes time. I am almost 55 (will be next and I feel that all of my life goes into what I compose now. When someone asks me how long it took to create a certain song, I reply ’55 years and two weeks’ or whatever age I happened to be when the piece was completed. A Christian writer ought never to dry up or peter out, when he or she is in daily contact with Christ, the Living Word, and with the written Word. We can get better as we grow in in experience, and in this age of youth culture. That is delightfully opposite from the trend among so many worldly people.\n\n“I write with people in mind, of course, but I write to please the Lord primarily. I want to feel that he takes delight in what I create that in my lyrics I express in verse truths from His word. His approval is what I seek.”\n\nLeech’s other hymn in SDAH is No. 575, “Let Your Heart Be Broken.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "In the 1870s Bishop John H.  Vincent was one of the confounders of the Chautauqua Literacy and Scientific Circle. Students gathered in conference in a summer retreat at an old Methodist camp meeting site at Lake Chautauqua in the Finger Lakes region of   New York State. Their purpose was for self- improvement not only academically but spiritually. To assist in this latter function, in 1877 Vincent asked   Mary Artemisia  Lathbury (1841-1913; see SDAH 51) to write a study hymn for the group. She accordingly wrote the first two stanzas of hymn which derives a spiritual lesson from the feeding of the multitude with physical bread: “And looking up to heaven  he blessed,and brake,and  gave the loaves to his disciples and the disciples to the multitude” (Matt.14:19.The two original stanzas are similar in structures:(1) Break the bread of life as Thou didst break the actual loaves; and (2) Bless the truth,which is the bread of life, as Thou didst bless the actual bread. A third stanza was added by Alexander Groves (1842-1909) in the September 1913 issue of the Wesleyan Methodist Magazine, London, The last stanza is another addition.\n\nLathbury also wrote SDAH 51,”Day Is Dying in the West.” BREAD OF LIFE was composed in the summer of 1877 by William Fisk Sherwin (1826-1888; see Biographies) especially for the words. It first appeared in print in The Calvary Selections of Spiritual Songs, 1878.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "These words were written by Priscilla Jane Owens, born July 21, 1829. She was a public school teacher, and also a Sunday school teacher for 50 years in the Methodist church in Baltimore, Maryland. The stanza omitted is:\n\n4.  Give me the Bible, lamp of life immortal,\nHold up that splendor by the open grave;\nShow me the light from heaven’s shining port,\nShow me the glory gilding Jordan’s wave.\n\nOwens wrote poetry and prose for the Methodist Recorder and the Christian Standard. Her other hymns in SDAH are No. 340, “Jesus Saves,” and No. 534, “Will Your Anchor Hold?” She was born and spent all her life in Baltimore, Maryland, dying there on December 5, 1907.\n\nThe music was composed by Edmund Simon Lorenz, of Dayton, Ohio, a minister of the United Brethren Church. It was printed in his Holy Voices. Born near Canal Fulton, Ohio, July 13, 1854, Lorenz graduated from Yale with a B.D. degree, then pursued further study in music at the University of Leipzig, Germany. At the age of 20 he served as a music editor for the first United Brethren hymnal with music, Hymns of the Sanctuary, 1874. For two years he was president of Lebanon Valley College, Annville, Pennsylvania, but his health broke, and during a period of recuperation he concentrated on music. He began what became the very successful Lorenz and Company, music publisher, putting out two periodicals, The Choir Leader and The Choir Herald, and other church music and organ magazines. Besides composing hymn tunes and gospel songs, he published several books: Practical Church Music, 1909; Church Music, 1923; Music in Work and Worship, 1925; and The Singing Church, 1937. He kept us his activity in this thriving music business right up until his death July 11, 1942, at age 88, in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Under the title “The Word of God Is the Saint’s Satisfying Portion,” Isaac Watts (1674-1748; see Biographies) included this in his Psalms of David Imitated in the Language of the New Testament, 1719. It is a very free paraphrase of verses 57 to 64 of Psalm 119. Reference is also made to Psalm 119:111, “Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever,” which is noted by Watts under his title.\n\nSamuel Sebastian Wesley was born on August 14, 1810, at St. Pancras, London, the grandson of the great hymn-poet Charles Wesley (see Biographies). His father was a musician who idolized Johann Sebastian Bach, hence Samuel’s middle name. Studying music with his father, Samuel became a chorister in the  Royal Chapel at age 10. Becoming one of England’s most noted organists, he played at Hereford and  Exeter cathedrals, Leeds Parish Church (where there is a tablet to his memory), and Winchester and Gloucester cathedrals. Oxford University gave him the honorary D. Mus. degree in 1839, and in 1850 he was appointed professor of organ at the Royal Academy of Music. He was the famous for his ability to play extemporaneously, and for his determination to improve the standards of cathedral music and the status and salary of musicians. The tune WETHERBY is named for a small market town in Yorkshire near Leeds where Wesley served for seven years. It was originally set to Doddrige’s hymn “Awake, Ye Saints, and Raised Your Eyes,” in Wesley’s book The Europian Psalmist, 1872. This book contained 733 tunes, of which 130 were his own compositions. His other tunes in SDAH are Nos. 316 and 348, AURELIA, and 691, unnamed. Wesley died April 19, 1876, and was buried according to his wish at Exeter Cathedral.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "The Hymn Society of America is the source of a number of contemporary texts in SDAH.In the 1952 the society conducted a search for new hymns that express confidence in the Holy Bible. Out of some 550 entries this one was chosen for first award and was published in Ten New Hymns on the Bible, 1952. In September of that year it was sung in thousands of churches across North America, celebrating the publication of the Revised Standard Version of the Bible.\n\nSarah Ellen Taylor was born December 30, 1883, in Stockport, England, the daughter of an enthusiastic lay preacher. In 1892 the father brought the family to Cumberland, Rhode Island, where for many years he pastored the Primitive Methodist Church. Sarah was active in the church, teaching a class at age 15. She went to Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, and earned the B.A. and M.A. degrees before going to teach Latin, Greek, and English literature in mission schools in Alabama and Virginia. From 1917 to 1930 she was back at Cumberland, teaching in the high school, and for the next 19 years before retirement in 1949, she was a teacher at Central Falls High School. She died October 5, 1954.\n\nATKINSON is named after Gordon Atkinson, is a lifelong friend of the composer, who in 1978 was president of the Royal Canadian College of Organists. Cabena said it was written, “like many such tunes, on an impulse when I happened to feel that opening downward phrase, using the notes of the G chord, as the descending wisdom of God to give us, through the pen of the inspired men of old, the Holy Scriptures.\n\nHarold Barrie Cabena is one of Canada’s most distinguished musicians, being an organist, composer, and teacher. Born August 12, 1933, in Melbourne, Australia, he privately studied music there before going to the Royal College of Music, London, where he trained under John Dykes Bower and Herbert Howells, earning the senior prize in organ. In 1957 he went to Canada to be director of music at First-St. Andrew’s United Church, London, Ontario. In 1970 he began teaching on the faculty of Wilfrid Laurier University, Waterloo, Ontario. He has served on the examining committee for the Royal Canadian College of Organists and was president of that organization from 1967 to 1969. He was toured extensively as a virtuoso recitalist. His compositions total more than 100, including organ works, anthems, piano works, Masses, an opera for children, and choral pieces. In 1972 he was awarded the Silver Medal of L’Academie Francaise- Arts, Sciences, Letters, for services to French music.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

The tune’s first American appearance was in the Methodist Hymnal (now known as The Book of Hymns), 1966. The composer’s home church, Wylde Green, was in the northern suburb of   Birmingham, England. The accompaniment is rich in harmony, and the melody has a wide sweep that is typical of the tunes written about this time for the boys’ private schools in Britain.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "This is the only hymn text written by Ruth Carter. In a Congregational Sunday school where she was a leader, a course of lessons was given on “How we got the Bible,” about 1932. At the end of the course she could find no hymn to sum up the points that arose, and so she wrote these words to fulfill that need. It was used occasionally for the next five years. Carter thought that it might be shared with other groups of children ages 8 to 11 and sent it to the Graded School Advisor at the National Sunday School Union; it appeared in the Graded Schools Intermediate Quarterly in 1937. From that magazine it was picked up by hymnals in many countries. The words “Thee” and “Thy” in the original version were changed to “You” and “Your” in the Australian Songs of Worship, 1968. Carter graciously agreed to take into her hymn stanza 4 as proposed by the committee working in the Australian Hymn Book, 1977, where the full hymn is printed with the old German tune, ALL SAINTS.\n\nRuth Carter was born August 22, 1900, at Upper, Clapton, London, and educated at a small private school  at Buckhurst Hill, Essex, where her family moved when she was 9. After attendance at a Methodist boarding school in Kent, she became active member of the Buckhurst Hill United Reformed Church, and made her home there. For 20 years until retirement in 1975, she made a career of remedial teaching of boys and girls at her home.\n\nThe SDAH Committee, wishing a new tune for this fine text on the Bible, sent the poem to some 30 SDA composers.  From those submitted, HOLY BOOK was chosen.\n\nBlythe Owen was born December 26, 1898, at Bruce, Minnesota, into a musical family. Her mother was the “town musician,” singing and playing the organ. Young Blythe started music lessons on a pump organ. When she was 8, a piano was added to the family treasures – to her great delight. Living for a while in North Dakota, the family had no SDA church privileges and attended Baptist and Methodist Sunday schools. At the age of 18 she graduated from a music conservatory and spent some 30 years in Chicago, Illinois, as a performer, teacher, and composer. She taught at Cosmopolitan School of Music, Chicago Teachers College, Northwestern University, and Roosevelt University. For six summers she studied at Eastman School of Music, Rochester, New York, studying composition with Howard Hanson. In 1949 a session at Ecole des Americaina at Fontainebleau, France, brought her into contact with teachers Nadia Boulanger and Francis Poulenc. As a teacher at Walla Walla College in 1961, she was president of the  Music Teachers’ Association, played cello in the Walla Walla Symphony, and by commission wrote a work performed by that orchestra. A world traveler, in 1968, Owen toured the Orient, giving recitals and master classes at Japan, Taipei, Hong Kong, Manila, Singapore, and India. The winter quarter of 1972 found her teaching at Avondale College, Australia. In 1981 she was guest professor at the University of Montemorelos, Mexico, appearing there twice in the concert series. Her final post before retirement was a professor of music, teaching composition at Andrews University, Berrien Springs, Michigan, where she received an honorary doctorate in 1979.\n\nA prolific composer, her compositions have won numerous local, national, and international awards, and have had many performances at festivals, universities, churches, and over the radio. A great variety of compositions have come from her pen, including works for orchestra, chamber groups, individual instruments and piano, organ, chorus, band, and solo voice, a number of which were published by major music publisher. She has written several hymn tunes, and writes, “I am very pleased that one of my hymns has been accepted [for SDAH], for this is the way I reach the church people, and this is my offering to the Lord and the church.” Owens lives in retirement near Andrews University.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Howard Charles Adie Gaunt was born in Birmingham, England, November 13, 1902. He attended King’s College at Cambridge, receiving the B.A. in 1925 and the M.A. in 1927. After study at Cuddeson Theological College in 1954, he became a priest in 1955. His career included the following positions: assistant master at Winchester College, 1953 -1963; chaplain and sacristan at Winchester Cathedral, 1963-1966; precentor, 1966-1973; honorary canon, 1966- 1974; and canon emeritus from 1974 until his death in 1983.\n\nThe composer appropriately named BLUEBONNET after the official flower of his home state. This text was sent to some 30 Seventh-day Adventist composers who were asked for an original tune. Of all those submitted, this one was chosen.  It is composed in the style of the early American folk hymn tune (see SDAH 363), the melody being entirely in the pentatonic scale, and was arranged by Melvin West (1930-; see Biographies) especially for this book.\n\nJohn W. Read was born April 25, 1933, in Lufkin, Texas, and received his B.A. from Madison College, Madison, Tennessee. Graduate study at University of Texas, Austin, led to M.A. in 1958 and the D. Ed. At North Texas State University, Denton, in 1968. His career has included teaching at Campion Academy; Shenandoah Valley Academy; Collegedale Academy; and Southwestern Adventist College, Keene, Texas, where he led out in developing a curriculum for the major in music. A versatile musician, he taught voice, elementary school music, composition, and directed choral organizations. In 1981 he began a pioneering work as coordinator of church music for the Texas Conference, seeking to build up the concept and possibilities of a local church music ministry. With his own publishing house, Clarion Call Music, Inc., he publishes choral works for SDA composers and others. Read was a member of the SDAH Committee and the subcommittee for tunes. Presently he is pastoring churches in Texas. He served as president for the SDA Church Musicians’ Guild in 1985-1986. His other work in SDAH is No. 677, “Heavenly Father, to Thee We Pray,” and its unnamed tune.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

It was published in five stanzas in his Salvation Melodies, 1874. The refrain originally began with the words “Come to Jesus” used three times, but Ira D. Sankey changed them to “Only trust Him” as given in his Sacred Songs and Solos, 1875.\n\nThe message of the hymn is the simple one of forgiveness to those who have faith and trust in Christ. The main Scripture allusion is to Psalm 52:8: “I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.”\n\nIra D. Sankey (see Biographies) found the hymn in his scrapbook, liked it, and used it, giving the name STOCKTON to the tune. The melody is in the pentatonic scale, i.e., an octave lacking the fourth and seventh notes.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "yearWritten": 1759,
    "historicalContext": "In 1759 Joseph Hart published this text in Hymns Composed on Various Subjects With the Author’s Experience. The first line originally read “Come, ye sinners, poor and wretched” and had seven six-line stanzas bearing the title “Come, and Welcome to Jesus Christ.”\n\nThe words of the refrain are from an anonymous hymn that appeared in nineteenth –century hymnbooks. It was based on Jesus’ story of the prodigal son, found in Luke 15:11-32.\n\nJoseph Hart was born in 1712 in London to Christian parents. He received a liberal education and become a schoolteacher. At first deeply religious, he strayed away and indulged in evil practices. He even wrote and published writings against Christianity and religion of any kind. One pamphlet he wrote was “The Unreasonableness of Religion, Being Remarks and Animadversions on the Rev. John Wesley’s Sermon on Romans 8:32. “ In the end, though, the higher nature triumphed, and he was converted in 1757 in the Moravian Chapel in Fetter Lane, London. He gained a new and clearer view of the sufferings of  Christ, and his heart was changed. It was in the joy of his experience that he wrote this hymn. About the year 1760 he became pastor of the Jewin Street Congregational Chapel, London, and served there until his death on May 24, 1768.\n\nThe tune RESTORATION, or ARISE, or I WILL ARISE, is an American folk melody, parts of which have been traced to several secular melodies in England and Ireland. It was immensely popular with the compilers of the southern tune books and appeared in William Walker’s Southern Harmony, 1835, where it was set to a different text. The arrangement is by Melvin West (1930-; see Biographies).\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "Frances Ridley Havergal (1836- 1879; see Biographies) was staying in Dusseldorf, Germany. Returning to her host’s house, tired and weary, on January 10, 1858, she sat down to rest in the study. In front of her was a picture of the Savior, beneath which was the motto “I did this for Thee! What hast thou done for Me?” The lines of this hymn flashed into her mind, and taking a scrap of paper, she hastily scribbled them down. Upon reading the words later she considered it to be a poor effort and threw the paper in the fire. However it fell out and on the second thought she decided to retain it. She returned to England and some months later showed the poem of her father, who suggested she keep it. He himself wrote a tune, BACA, especially for it. The original has six stanzas. The hymn was published as a leaflet in 1859 and appeared in Good Words in 1860. It appeared in her Poetical Works, Volume II, 1884, with a Scripture text suggested for each line.\n\nWHITE commemorates the name of the composer, James Edson White, second son of James and Ellen Gould White. He was born July 28, 1849, the same year his father published the first SDA hymnal. He produce the Song Anchor, a Sabbath school hymnal, in 1878; wrote this tune in 1881; and assisted in the selection of hymns for the official hymnbook of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Hymns and Tunes, 1886. Indeed, the setting of the type, both in the music and words, for this hymnal was allotted to the J.E. White Publishing Company, which he had founded in 1880 at Battle Creek.\n\nWhite began work at the age of 15 in the Review and Herald office and learned to be a printer. In 1877 he was called to Oakland, California, to serve as manager of the Pacific Publishing Association. In 1893 he felt the burden to preach the gospel to the underprivileged Black population of America and had his steamboat, Morning Star, built in 1894. It was completely equipped as a place of residence, together with a library, chapel, print shop, and photographic room. With his helpers he work particularly in the Yazoo River area, conducting schools, printing and distributing papers, and teaching reading to the illiterate. Many schools were established, which helped to develop the Seventh-day Adventist work in the South. White died on May 30, 1928.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "historicalContext": "This hymn was written by William Walsham How (1823- 1897; see Biographies). It appeared in Supplement to Psalms and Hymns, by Morrell and How, 1867, in six stanzas of four line each. It was not directly inspired by Holman Hunt’s famous painting The Light of the World, but both hymn and picture were based on the text “ Behold,  I stand at the door, and knock” (Rev.3:20). How had read a moving poem by Jean Ingelow (1820-1897) entitled “Brothers and a Sermon,” in which the following lines occur:\n\n“Behold!” said He, “I stand at the door and knock! Open the door with shame, if ye have sinned.”\n\nHow scribbled his first draft of the hymn onto an odd scrap of paper, entitling it “Jesus at the Door,” and subsequently revised it slightly. The hymn now appears in 3 eight-line stanzas.\n\nST. HILDA was adapted by Justin Heinrich Knecht from a collection published in Stuttgart in 1799. It was further altered in 1871, and given this name by Edward Husband, who was born in 1843 in Hampshire, England. Husband was an amateur organist and composer, and vicar of Folkstone, Kent, where he died on January 3, 1908. Hilda was a person of royal blood who established a monastery near Whitby, Yorkshire, in the seventh century, and there revived the standards of the early Christian church.\n\nKnecht was born at Biberach, north of the Lake Constance, on September 30, 1752, and was largely a self-taught musician. He learned to play the flute, oboe, trumpet, violin, and organ. In 1771 he was appointed music director and organist at Biberach. He had other talents also, for he was professor of  literature in 1792 in the same town. In 1806 he was invited to Stuttgart to become the conductor of both court and theater orchestras. He returned to his hometown in 1808, and died there at age 65 on December 1, 1817. He wrote music for the stage, some vocal works, one symphony, and church music for organ and choir.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

He left the established Anglican Church in 1874 and joined the Plymouth Brethren, still later joining a “holiness” sect. His songs published in a series called Timogue Leaflets; this one in 1860.\n\nIra D. Sankey (1840-1908; see Biographies), in Ireland in 1874 with evangelist D. L. Moody, came across one of the above –mentioned leaflets containing Cluff’s poem “I Have a Savior, He’s Pleading in Glory.” Setting these words to music was Sankey’s second attempt at composing a hymn tune (the first was Horatius Bonar’s [see SDAH 79] “Yet There Is Room”). It became immensely popular when he used it a few weeks later in the London meetings. He included the song in his successful book Sacred Songs and Solos, which eventually grew through several editions to contain some 1,200 pieces.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

It is based on the call of the disciples; “And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother.... And he saith unto them, Follow Me” (Matt.4:18, 19). The less prominent apostle, Andrew, is referred to in the omitted stanza:\n\n2. As of old St. Andrew heard it \nBy the Galilean lake,  \nTurned from home, and toil, and kindred,\nLeaving all for His dear sake.\n\nAlexander also wrote SDAH 93, “All Things Bright and Beautiful,” SDAH 149, “Once in Royal David’s  City,” and SDAH 164, “There Is a Green Hill Far Away,”.\n\nGALILEE was composed by William Herbert Jude especially for these words; it was first published in 1887 in Congregational Church Hymns, Jude was born in Westleton, Suffolk, England, in September 1851, and became organist at the Blue Coat Hospital, Liverpool; in 1889 he became organist at the Stretford Town Hall, Greater Manchester. He traveled extensively in Great Britain and Australia, lecturing and giving recitals. He edited several songs, and anthems. He was a member of the Baptist Church, and died at Willesden, London, on August 8, 1922.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "Both words and music of this gospel song were composed in 1874 by Philip Bliss; it first appeared in Words of Life, 1874, a Sunday school paper in New York. The popularity of this music is no doubt a result of the singable melody in the soprano and the duet formed with the alto part, usually a third or sixth below.\n\nBliss was born in Clearfield County, Pennsylvania, on July 9, 1838, to religious and musical parents who lived in a log cabin. He saw and heard a piano for the first time when he was about 10, and was enthralled with the harmony of the sound. As a young lad he worked on farms and in lumber camps, and accepted Christ, joining the Baptist Church at age 12. After a winter of music  study with J. G. Towner, father of D. B. Towner (see SDAH 109), and attendance at a convention at Rome, Pennsylvania, conducted by William B. Bradbury (see Biographies), he taught at Rome Academy. He boarded with and worked on the farm for O.F. Young, and at age 21 married Young’s daughter, Lucy. For several years Bliss taught music during the winter months and work on the farm in the summer. In 1864 he sent an original song to Root and Cady Music Publisher, Chicago, offering it to them if they would send him a flute. Recognizing a budding talent, they sent him the flute, and later gave him a job concertizing and holding conventions for the company. For four years he did this, and for four more years concertizing independently before joining with evangelist Major D. W. Whittle (see SDAH197) as soloist and song leader. They held revival meeting in Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and several Southern states, and all the time he was writing message- filled gospel songs.\n\nAfter accepting an invitation to go to England for some meetings, he and Lucy went to Rome, Pennsylvania, and spent Christmas with his family. On December 29, 1876, they were on the trip back to Chicago where he was to sing in Moody’s tabernacle, when a bridge gave way; the train plunged into the icy river below and burst into flames. It was reported that Bliss survived the fall, got out through a window, then went back in to try to save Lucy. Both lost their lives in the flames. Among his publications for the Sunday school were The Charm, 1871, and Sunshine, 1873. With Ira D. Sankey he compiled Gospel Hymns and Sacred Songs, Nos. 1 and 2. He also compiled several collections with G. F. Root, who had this to say about Bliss: “If ever a man seemed fashioned by the divine hand for a special and exalted work, that man was P. P. Bliss. He had a splendid physique, a handsome face, and a dignified, striking presence. [His] voice was always a marvel to me. Beginning with a D-flat below [F-clef], he would, without apparent effort, produce a series of clarion tones, in an ascending series, until having reached G space above [C-clef] with pure tone.”\n\nBliss also wrote the music for SDAH 530, “It Is Well With My Soul,” and the words for SDAH 343, “I Will Sing of My Redeemer.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

It was used extensively in Europe and America by the Moody-Sankey evangelistic team. The words are an enlargement of the pleading words of the Savior to those who are weighed down and weary with the burden of sin; “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest” (Matt.11:28). Just before the great evangelist Moody died, Thompson visited him in the sick room. Recognizing the visitor, Moody said feebly, “Will, I would rather have written ‘Softly and Tenderly’ than anything I have been able to do with my whole life.”\n\nThompson’s other hymn in SDAH is No. 185, “Jesus Is All The World To Me,” for which he wrote both words and music.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "In the year 1971, when Brian Wren’s (1936-; see Biographies) children were young, it was a household habit to tune to the BBC program Listen With Mother. One day Wren’s wife, Brenda, heard this children’s song sung to a traditional English melody:\n\nI am going to Timbuktu,\nWould you like to go there too,\nAll the way and back again?\nYou must follow the leader then.\n\nShe suggested to her husband the words of stanza I, which he promptly extended into the complete song. It is a delightful way for children to sing about and absorb the experience of Jesus dying on the cross. Here Jesus is telling the story Himself and inviting them to come along and play “follow the leader.” As Wren says: “There is no reason why a song about the Crucifixion should be in a minor key, and our guess is that children will like and understand it.” It will surely help them to understand Jesus’ words in Matthew 16:24, “If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.”\n\nSEE SAW SACCARA DOWN is the name supplied with the arrangement of this tune, made in 1972 by Charles E. Strange. Strange was born in 1902 at Oxford, and now lives in retirement in the Palmers Green section of London. He describes himself as a “retired civil servant, organist, and choirmaster.” He served from 1954 to 1972 on the Public Worship and Aids to Devotion Committee of the then Presbyterian Church (now United Reformed Church) of England. From 1964 to 1972 he was a member of the Revision Committee for the book The Church Hymnary. For many years he was editor of the Guild Review, of the United Reformed Church Guild of Organist and Choirmaster. His musical contributions appear in the book New Church Praise, a hymnal supplement published in 1975 for the United Reformed Church.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

Carmichael says that in the 1960s the song was taken by Bob Pierce to the Orient, where it was used in choir and solo arrangement in his evangelistic meetings. From there it spread all over the world, and now is in many standard hymnbooks.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "The author of both words and music of this invitation hymn told how it was written. It was 1918, and she saw the following words in a pamphlet by missionary Lillias Trotter: “So then, turn your eyes upon Him. Look full into His face, and you will find that the things of earth will acquire strange, new dimness.”\n\n“Suddenly,” she said, “as if commanded to stop and listen, I stood still, and singing in my soul and spirit was the chorus, with not one conscious moment of putting word to word to make rhyme, or note to note to make melody.... The verses were written... the same week, after the usual manner of composition, but nonetheless dictated by the Holy Spirit.”\n\nThe song was published by the British National Sunday School Union in Glad Songs, 1922, a book of 67 of Lemmel’s works. It became popular in England, then moved to America in 1924 when Harry D. Clarke printed it in his Gospel Truth in Song, No. 2.\n\nHelen Howarth Lemmel was born November 14, 1864, in Wardle, Greater Manchester, England, the daughter of a Wesleyan Methodist pastor. When she was 9 the family moved to America and settled in Wisconsin. She was a fine singer and studied extensively in the United States and Germany, using her talent in concerts, churches, and with a women’s quartet in the Chautauqua Circuit. After a time of teaching privately, she held positions at Monday Bible Institute at both the Chicago and Los Angeles campuses. Her final home for 57 years was in Seattle, Washington, where she was an active member of the Ballard Baptist Church before her death November 1, 1961. Some 500 hymns and a large volume of children’s music came from her facile pen. She died at age 96.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "This hymn by Thomas Benson Pollock appeared in Supplemental Hymns to Hymns Ancient and Modern, 1889, under the title “Seeking God.” It recalls the rebuke addressed to the church of Ephesus: “Thou hast left thy first love” (Rev.2:4). Each of the four stanzas confess a sin of omission and pleads for cure, e. g., light for ignorance, faith to generate godly fear, love to appreciate God’s love, and zeal for service. The last stanza summarizes these four aspects of communion with God.\n\nPollock was born at Strahallan, Isle of Man, on May 28, 1836, and educated at Trinity College, Dublin. He began as a medical student but changed to theology and was ordained in 1861. He held various curacies until 1865, when he went to be curate to his brother, who was the vicar of St. Albans, Bordesley, Birmingham. It was in a poor district but he built a fine church there. However the brothers had very definite High Church leanings, and they were subjected to mob violence by those opposed to the Tractarian movement and Anglo-Catholicism. After 30 years there as a curate, he succeeded his brother as vicar, but died 10 months later at Bordesley, on December 15, 1896. Pollock also wrote SDAH 374, “Jesus, With Thy Church Abide.”\n\nST. CHRYSOSTOM was composed in 1871 by Joseph Barnby (1838-1896; see Biographies) for a hymn in similar meter, “Jesus, My Lord, My God, My All.” Chrysostom, whose Greek name means “golden-mouth,” lived from A.D. 347 to 407; he earned this title because he was a most eloquent orator and theologian. At one time he was archbishop of Constantinople.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

One night the sermon was on John 3:7, “Ye must be born again,” and Stebbins was impressed with the idea that the words would make a good song. He asked the local pastor, W. T. Sleeper, to write the poem, and he set it to music. This collaboration on the creation of a gospel song was the start of a long friendship between the two men. When Sleeper wrote the words for “Jesus, I Come,” he sent them to Stebbins, who wrote this music. It was first printed in Gospel Hymns No. 5, 1887, under the Scripture text, “Deliver me, O my God” (Ps. 71:4).\n\nWilliam True Sleeper was born February 9, 1819, at Danbury, New Hampshire, and received his education at the University of   Vermont and Andover Theological Seminary. After ordination to the Congregational ministry, he did pioneer mission work in Worcester, Massachusetts, and raised up three new churches in Maine. In 1876 he went back to Worcester and for 30 years pastored the first church that he had begun as a mission. In 1883 he published a book of poems, The Rejected King, and Hymns of Jesus. He died September 24, 1904, at Wellesley, Massachusetts.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "This hymn was written and published in The Voice of Praise, 1872, a hymnbook for the Methodist Episcopal Church. Clark was a member of the committee that prepared the book. An earnest prayer for God’s blessing, it has been in a number of American Methodist hymnals, including the 1964 edition.\n\nAlexander Clark was born March 10, 1834, in Jefferson County, Ohio, and was educated by his scholarly father. He began teaching at age 17 and started editorial work that would capture his attention for most of his life. Eventually, he edited the Methodist Recorder, an official organ of the church; wrote articles for other magazines; preached and lectured extensively; and authored inspirational books and a small volume of poems. He died at Atlanta, Georgia, July 6, 1879.\n\nAUS DER TIEFE (“Out of the Depths”; also known as HEINLEIN) first appeared with the hymn beginning with these words, under the initials “M. H.,” in the German book Nurnbergisches Gesangbuch, 1676. Scholars are fairly sure that those initials stand for Martin Herbst. Born January 15, 1654, at Rothenbach, Germany, Herbert studied at the St. Lorenz’s School in Nuremberg. Later he studied theology and philosophy at Altdorf and Jena. In 1680 he became rector of the Gymnasium at Eisleben and pastor of St. Andreas Church there. Unfortunately, he contracted the plague and died in 1681 at the age of 27. He was the probable composer of four of the melodies in the Nuremberg songbook mentioned above.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "The key thought of these words is: “They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb” (Rev.12:11). Both words and music of this spirited gospel song were written while Jones was attending a camp meeting at Mountain Lake Park, Maryland. H. L. Gilmour (see SDAH 368) liked it well enough to purchase the song and included it in Songs of Praise and Victory, 1899, which he compiled with William J. Kirkpatrick (see Biographies).\n\nLewis Edgar Jones was born February 8, 1865, at Yates City, Illinois. He went to school with Billy Sunday, the famous evangelist at Moody Bible Institute, Chicago. After graduation, Jones spent most of his life working for the YMCA, serving in Davenport, Iowa; Fort Worth, Texas; and Santa Barbara, California. He died at the latter place on September 1, 1936, 11 years after his retirement. Writing both words and music of songs and hymns was ongoing hobby with Jones; many of his works were published under the pseudonyms Lewis Edgar, Edgar Lewis, and Mary Slater.\n\nThis song is typical of thousands written around the turn of the century. They have utterly simple harmonic patterns, melodies that use the notes of the primary chords, and spritely rhythm.\n\nIn the book Charles M. Alexander, A Romance of Song and Soul Winning, by Helen C. Alexander and J. Kennedy Maclean, this story is told: In 1909, evangelist J. Wilbur Chapman, with singing evangelist Charles Alexander, was holding meetings in the Great Exhibition Hall, Melbourne, Australia. On “Alexander Night,” the three-hour festival of song under the great singing evangelist’s magic direction, there were some 10,000 people in the audience and 1,200 in the choir. Reporter W. A. Somerset Shum wrote vivid, sparkling descriptions of what happened for the paper The Southern Cross. His report included the following: “The eyes of the conductor are now upon a lady in a wheelchair in front. ‘And what hymn would you like?’ he asked sympathetically. She chooses ‘Power in the blood.’ ‘We used to make this old building ring with that seven years ago. Sing the chorus, choir: “There is power, power, wonder-working power.” ‘The word ‘power’ vibrates and echoes. ‘Do you want another verse?’ and the invalid smiles back her wish. The verse is sung. ‘You’ve got them to sing better than I did.’ How many hours will be cheered for her in the long days by the memory of this night!”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

His writings are published in his Poetical Works, 1864. He died about 1870.\n\nSPANISH HYMN is an arrangement published in 1826 by Benjamin Carr (1769-1831), an Englishman who emigrated to the United States and became a music dealer and music printer. Carr was an organist in Philadephia, and helped to introduce both operatic and classical music to America. Notice that the third score is an exact repetition of the first score and the second score has two musical phrases exactly alike. (See SDAH 10, MADRED, for a modification of the tune.)\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "Both words and music were written by William James Kirkpatrick (1838-1921; see Biographies) and were prompted because he had a burden for a young man’s soul. He was the song leader at a camp meeting at Rawlinsville, Pennsylvania, in 1902 and had used a certain soloist frequently. This singer had a wonderful voice and used it very expressively and emotionally, but Kirkpatrick knew that this was merely outward form, for the soloist was by no means a Christian; the sermons and the appeals of the evangelist had failed to move him. Kirkpatrick longed for this talented voice to be wholeheartedly dedicated to the cause of Christ, and he prayed in his own private devotions that the singer would be convinced of his need of a Savior. He thought of his prodigal son who said, “I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee” (Luke 15:18). While Kirkpatrick was still in prayer, the words of the refrain formed themselves in his mind. Concluding his prayer, he wrote down the words, and then the five stanzas followed in the quick succession. He soon composed a suitable tune and believed that this song was God’s answer to his prayer for the young singer. In the evening Kirkpatrick handed the manuscript to the singer, who rendered it with his customary fervor and interpretation. But the song reached his heart as well as his mind and voice, and caused him to surrender his life to God.\n\nThe song was first printed in Winning Songs, 1892, compiled by Kirkpatrick and two colleagues.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

The hymn’s first appearance in an American hymnal was in Bible Songs, a selection of psalms set to music, for use in Sunday schools and adult Bible classes, Pittsburgh, 1924. It was used later in four Presbyterian hymnals until 1929.\n\nThe tune REFUGE is found in a number of older hymnals, including F. E. Belden’s Christ in Song, where it was with “Jesus, Lover of  My Soul.” Joseph Perry Holbrook was born in 1822 near Boston. He was associated with Charles S. Robinson and served as musical editor for the latter’s hymnals, the most popular of which were Songs of the Church (it was in this book that REFUGE was first printed), 1862, and songs of the Sanctuary, 1865. He assisted Dr. Eben Tourjee (see SDAH 114) in compiling the 1878 Methodist hymnal. His own book, Worship in Song, 1880, did not prove to be successful. He died in 1888.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "historicalContext": "Horatius Bonar (1808-1889; see SDAH 79) is considered the greatest of the Scottish hymn writers. No other has approached him in number and popularity of hymns.  He was the great lover of children, and wrote these words (thought to be his first or second hymn) in order to provide something they could easily sing and understand in the divine worship service. It was written about 1834 in four-line stanzas; it was revised and published in 1843 in Bonar’s Songs for the Wilderness, in four 8-line stanzas that he titled “The Fullness of Jesus.” It was first sung by Bonar’s Sunday school class at South Leith, where he was assistant minister. The hymn text is based on John 1:29: “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.” Bonar said the hymn was good gospel but not good poetry, and he was surprised that it became so popular.\n\nThe fourth stanza in SDAH should read “I long to be like Jesus,” not “with Jesus.” (This error occurred in the first printings of SDAH.) Bonar also wrote SDAH 79, “O Love of God, How Strong and True”; SDAH 217, “The Church Has Waited Long”; and SDAH 465, “I Heard the Voice of Jesus.”\n\nThe composer, Allen W. Foster (1940-;see SDAH 151) writes: “This hymn tune, BRADLEY, was composed in May 1964 on a Sabbath morning just prior to leaving home for church services. It is name for the street in Camden, New Jersey, where my wife, Gwendolyn, and I resided. We had been married about 11 months at that time. First performed by her during a Philadelphia evangelistic campaign with Charles D. Brooks in 1964, it has become one of his favorite songs. Recording of this hymn have been made on the Chapel label by Charles L. Brooks as a solo, and in a choral arrangement by the Ebenezer Seventh-day Adventist Church choir, where I was organist.” The melody gives a pleasant surprise in the middle of the third score. One would expect it to conclude on the high notes, but another musical phrase follows, repeating the first four notes of the preceding phrase (with different harmony) and then completing the cadence.\n\nFoster was a member of SDAH Committee. He arrange SDAH 151, “Jesus Walked This Lonesome Valley,” and composed the tunes at SDAH 203, CHALLENGE, and SDAH 417, FINALLY.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "The Hymnal Companion to the Lutheran Book of Worship quotes the author on how the hymn was written: “The idea of writing the ‘Forgiveness’ hymn came to me some years ago when I was digging up docks in a long-neglected garden. Realizing how these deeply-rooted weeds were choking the life of the flowers in the garden, I came to feel that deeply-rooted resentments in our lives would destroy every Christian virtue and all joy and peace unless, by God’s grace, we learned to forgive.” The hymn was first used in two modern hymnbook in Britain in 1969, then it made its way to America in Lutheran Book of Worship, 1978.\n\nRosamond Eleanor Herklots’ British parents were living in Masuri, North India, when she was born June 22, 1905. Back at home in England, she was educated at Leeds Girls’ High School and Leeds University. For a while she was a teacher, then she change to secretarial work for neurologist. She wrote verse from childhood, but as she says, hymns “intended to express in simple words of faith, hope, and dedication of the ordinary Christian” came along later in life. In 1978 she was a secretary in the head office of the Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus in London. She has written about 70 hymns, two of which won places in the final “Telecast of Hymns for Britain” competition.\n\nDETROIT is one of those tunes sometimes classified in the generic Sacred Harp tradition-religious songs in early America that were based on, or composed in the style of, folk songs brought over from England and Ireland. George Pullen Jackson, noted authority on this songs, says in Spiritual Folk-Songs of Early America that DETROIT is found in at least 10 of these shaped-note songbooks, including the 1820 Supplement to Kentucky Harmony; Virginia Harmony, 1831, and Southern Harmony, 1835, where it was credited to “Bradshaw”; and The Sacred Harp, 1844, edited by B. F. White and E.J. King.\n\nThe tune is similar to that of “The Wife of Usher’s Well,” an English folk song found by Cecil Sharp in the southern Appalachian Mountains. These are several different rhythmical versions of the tune, the one SDAH uses being from Lutheran Book of Worship, 1978, as arranged by Walter L. Pelz (1926- ), a teacher, and choral conductor at Bethany College, Lindsborg, Kansas, since 1969. Notice the different rhythm in the example printed above, taken from an early edition of The Sacred Harp. (The melody is in the third line down.) This hymn should be sung no faster than the run of the eighth notes in the third measure can be sung comfortably.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "This hymn first appeared as such in 1776 in the Gospel Magazine at the end of an article by the editor, Augustus Montague Toplady. The article had a long and unusual title, “A Remarkable Calculation Introduced Here for the Sake of the Spiritual Improvements Subjoined. Questions and Answers Relating to the National Dept.” It was probably stimulated by Toplady’s argument with the Wesleys concerning perfection, and his effort as a Calvinist to refute their Arminian teaching on this doctrine. His point was to show that the number of sins committed by even a professing Christian constituted a debt so enormous that he would never be able to pay it. Toplady calculated that the average number of sins was thousands of millions, and so he entitled his hymn, “A Living and Dying Prayer for the Holiest Believer in the World.” Even a good-living Christian had one hope only, namely that “the Lord hath laid on him the  iniquity of us all” (Isa.53: 6).\n\nActually, the first two lines of the hymn plus the last two lines from the omitted stanza appeared as a four-line verse in an earlier issue of the Gospel Magazine. The omitted stanza is:\n\n3. Nothing in my hand I bring \nSimply to Thy cross I cling;\nNaked, come to Thee for dress, \nHelpless, look to Thee for grace; \nFoul, I to the Fountain fly,\nWash me, Savior, or I die.\n\nToplady’s last stanza has been modified from its original:\n\n4.Whilst I draw this fleeting breath-\nWhen my eye-strings break in death-\nWhen I soar through tracts unknown-\n\nToplady was born in Farnham, Surrey, England, on November 4, 1740, but before he was 1 year old his father was killed at the siege of Cartagena. A few years later his mother moved to Ireland and he was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, gaining his B. A. in 1760 and his M. A. later on. He was converted after listening to a Wesleyan lay preacher and entered the Anglican ministry in 1762. He was ordained that year and appointed as curate to the parish of Blagdon, Somerset, in the Mendip Hills. He ministered there until 1764; in 1768 he was appointed to the village of Broadhemburry, in Devonshire, northeast of Exeter. Ill heath caused him to resign from this post, and in 1775 he took charged of the French Calvinist Church in Leicester Field, London. He was involved in bitter controversy in defending his Calvinist doctrines against the Arminian views of the Wesley brothers, and published a defense of his beliefs in 1774. He also wrote Psalms and Hymns for Public and Private Worship, 1776, as well as poems on sacred subjects. He finally succumbed to tuberculosis and died in Kensington, London, on August 11, 1778. A few miles away from Blagdon in the limestone cave country around Burrington Combe is a memorial to this hymn “Rock of Ages.” The story of his sheltering in a crevice between the limestone slabs is unfounded; the story did not become current until the 1850s, and Toplady ministered at Blagdon 12 or more years before he wrote the hymn.\n\nTOPLADY, named to commemorate the author of the words, was composed in 1830 by Thomas Hastings. The last two lines are a repetition of the first two; generally speaking, only three chords are used in the music.\n\nHastings was born in Washington, Connecticut, on October 15, 1784. When he was 2 years old, his family moved to Clinton, New York. His musical talent soon became evident, for when he was 18 years old he was leading the village choir. He taught music in 1806, and from 1816 onward devoted hid whole time to music. With Solomon Warriner, he published Musica Sacra and the Utica Collection of original tunes. In 1823 he settled in Utica, New York, and started a religious journal, the weekly Western Recorder, which he used to propagate his special views on church music, in order to attempt to rescue it from the low level to which it had sunk. His Union Minstrel appeared in 1830, and in the next year he and Lowell Mason published Spiritual Songs for Social Worship, mainly to counteract and offset the influence of Joshua Leavitt’s gospel hymns. His effort to improve the quality of church music led to his being called to New York to put his ideas into practice, and he served as choirmaster for 12 churches in that city. He was also the choir director in his own Presbyterian church. He associated with W. B. Bradbury in publishing many books on music and hymns through the next 20 years. Hastings, Bradbury, and Mason edited a psalmody collection. Hastings was honored by the University of New York in 1858, with the D. Mus. degree. During his long life he composed about 1,000 original tunes and wrote 600 texts, many of the latter for tunes already in use, fitted to words whose meters did not really correspond. He died on May 15, 1872, in New York City. To SDAH he has contributed tune Nos. 527, RETREAT, and 601, ZION, as well as the words of the third stanza of this hymn, “Rock of Ages.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

It came from her own personal experience with Christ and speaks of the compulsive drawing power of His love: “No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day” (John 6:44).\n\nLeila Naylor was born in Pennsville, Ohio, on April 15, 1862, and was converted at the age of 10 years. The family moved to Malta, but her father died, and she with her mother and sister moved to McConnelsville, Ohio, and opened a millinery shop there. She married C. H. Morris and was active in the Methodist Episcopal Church and in holiness camp meetings. She had both poetic and musical talent and, encouraged by H. L. Gilmour (see SDAH 368), wrote hymns, eventually totaling more than 1,000. She became blind in middle age but still continued her creative work, dictating her compositions to her daughter. This hymn first appeared in Pentecostal Praise, 1898. Leila Morris died at Auburn, Ohio, on July 23, 1929.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "This hymn emphasizes a continually increasing Christian experience, much in line with the testimony of the apostle Paul:  “Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after” (Phil. 3:12). The author has been forgiven, but he desires to remain free from sin; he has received blessing, yet desires more power; he has peace, but he desires purity.\n\nJohnson Oatman, Jr., was born April 21, 1856, at Medford, New Jersey, and educated at the New Jersey Collegiate Institute, Bordentown. He joined the Methodist Episcopal Church and was licensed to preach, later being ordained by Bishop Merrill. However, he remained for a while in the mercantile business with his father, then he started his own successful insurance business at Mt. Holly, New Jersey. Rather than regularly filling a specific pulpit, Oatman chose to minister to the whole world through the song-poems he wrote. More than 3,000 hymns and gospel songs flowed from his pen, set to music variously by William Kirkpatrick, Charles H. Gabriel, E. O. Excell, and John R. Sweney. “Count Your Blessings,” “No, Not One,” and “When Our  Ships Come Sailing Home,” were among his most successful songs. One more in SDAH in “Higher Ground,” No. 625. In a book published in Boston in early part of his career as a songwriter, Oatman made the following dedication:\n\nLet others sing of rights and wrongs,\nSing anything that pleases:\nBut while they’re singing other songs,\nI’ll sing a song for Jesus.\n\nHe died at Norman, Oklahoma, September 25, 1922. The tune DEEPER YET, named after the words of the refrain, was composed by William James Kirkpatrick.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "Elizabeth Cecilia Douglas Clephane, daughter of the sheriff of Fife, was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on June 18, 1830. When her father died, she and her two older sisters moved ultimately to Melrose, about 35 miles southeast of Edinburgh in the country made famous by the novels of Sir Walter Scott. They lived in Bridgend House, which, as its name suggests, was very near to the river Tweed. She had been asked to write a poem for a children’s magazine and was sitting in her room, seeking inspiration. Looking out of the window and seeing the bridge, in her imagination she visualized the monks of the nearby old abbey, passing over the bridge in bygone days. She saw a constant procession of these men, now dead and gone, and had a premonition that she too would soon depart this life. Her mind was full of her own experience, with the hopes and longings of a young Christian, and she decided that the topic of her poem should be the way of the cross of Christ. So the heading of her poem was Proverbs 14:26, “His children shall have a place of refuge.” The poem appeared posthumously in 1872 in Family Treasury, under the general tile of Breathings on the Border. Seven more of her poems appeared in other issues of this magazine. Clephane’s premonition unfortunately was fulfilled when she died at age 38, February 19, 1869, but her works live on.\n\nST. CHRISTOPHER, named after the patron saint of travelers, was composes expressly for these words by Frederick Charles Maker in 1881. Maker was born in 1844 in Bristol, was a chorister at the cathedral there, an organist at the Methodist Free Church, at a Congregational church, and then for 28 years, until 1910, at another Congregational church, all in Bristol. He died in Bristol on January 1, 1927. He was a visiting professor of music at Clifton College, and composed hymn tunes, anthems, cantatas, and piano pieces. His other tunes in SDAH are No. 481, REST, or ELTON, or WHITTIER, and No. 588, MELROSE.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "Frederick William Faber (1814-1863; see SDAH 114) wrote this hymn in 1849 after he had been in the Roman Catholic Church for three years. It is an ardent and unashamed propagation of this particular faith, although some of the words have been changed so that it can be sung heartily by any communion, Protestant or Catholic. The original third line of the first stanza was “Oh! Ireland’s heart beats high with joy,” but has now become “O how our hearts beat...” There were four stanzas of his hymn for England, but seven in the Irish version, the first four of which were very similar to the English version. The third stanza of the English version, which is now omitted for obvious reasons, was:\n\nFaith of our Fathers! Mary’s prayers\nShall win our country back to Thee;\nAnd through the truth that comes from God, \nEngland shall then indeed be free.\n\nThe Irish version of the line 2 was: “Shall keep our country fast to thee.” The first two stanzas recall the closing verses of the Bible’s faith chapter: “Who through faith... quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword... And others had trial... of bonds and imprisonment” (Heb. 11: 33-36). The hymn first appeared in Faber’s Jesus and Mary, 1849.  He also wrote SDAH 114, “There’s a Wideness.”\n\nST. CATHERINE was composed by Henri Frederick Hemy and appeared in his Crown of Jesus Music, 1864. It was so named because it was written for hymn titled “St. Catherine, Virgin and Martyr.” Catherine, a “maid most pure,” resisted the advances of Maxentius of Alexandria, and for this she was imprisoned.\n\nThe tune was adapted by James George Walton. Walton was born February 19, 1821, at Clitheroe, near Preston, on the river Ribble; he died September 1, 1905, at Bradford, Yorkshire. He authored Plainsong Music for the Holy Communion Office, 1874.\n\nHemy was born November 12, 1818, in Newcastle-on-Tyne, of German parents. He became organist at St. Andrews Roman Catholic Church in Newcastle. He taught music at nearby Tynemouth, and was professor of singing and piano at St. Cuthbert’s College at Ushaw in Durham. He wrote Easy Hymn Tunes of catholic Schools, 1851-1853, and the Royal Modern Tutor for the Pianoforte in 1858; the latter was very popular among piano teachers. He died at Hartlepool, a coastal town near Durham, on June 10, 1888.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "The Fisk Jubilee Singers were the first to carry Negro spirituals to the world after the Civil War. These 12 dedicated musicians made several successful concert tours, singing the songs of the freed people and raising money for Fisk University. The goal of their first tour was to raise the then huge amount of $20,000 for their school, which was founded in 1865 in Nashville, Tennessee, for Blacks. They sang it in concert halls and churches in Europe an dAmerica; their audiences included the president of the United States and the queen of England. In three years they raised $100000! In the year 1880 a book about their experiences was published by J.B.T. Marsh entitled The Story of the Jubilee Singers, With Their Songs. It included 128 spirituals and an account of the singer’s most recent trip to Germany. (This was a revision of two previous volumes.)\n\n“Give Me Jesus” was one of the numbers in the book. (See the reproduction of a slightly different melody line, on page 332.) It has the same message as the old gospel song, “Take the World, but Give Me Jesus,” SDAH 329. The refrain echoes the words of Jesus: “What is man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?” (Matt. 16:26).\n\nThe musical arrangement is by Alma Blackmon (1921-;see SDAH 69), who also arranged SDAH 138, “Rise Up, Shepherd, and Follow,” and SDAH 580, “This Little Light of Mine.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

One day they had a discussion on the nearness of God. That same evening during her personal devotions, while still on her knees, Crosby composed these words. It is significant that in the third stanza she mentions this attitude—“when I kneel in prayer.” The title of the hymn is “Holiness Desired”; it is a song of consecration based on the text “Let us draw near with a true heart un full assurance of faith” (Heb. 10:222).\n\nThe tune was furnished by her host, William H. Doane, making it another one of the numerous gospel songs originating from these two dedicated Christians. The song first appeared in the Sunday school songbook Brightest and Best, 1875.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "William McDonald, a Methodist Episcopal clergyman and evangelist, was sitting in his study one day in 1870 in Brooklyn, New York, when a line of thought came rushing into his head. He committed his thought to paper, and in a few minutes the words of this gospel song were written down. He was inspired by the melody of the tune TRUSTING as he wrote the words in 7.7.7.7.meter. The hymn was first sung at a camp meeting in Hamilton, Massachusetts, on June 22, 1870, and it was published in the American Baptist Praise Book, 1871. McDonald was prominent in the National Holiness movement and editor of the Boston Advocate of Christian Holiness. He was in need of a hymn “to aid seekers of heart purity while at the altar.” The hymn therefore was the outcome of his previous thought while occupied with this problem. There in one other stanza, the original fourth:\n\nIn Thy promises I trust,\nNow I feel the blood applied:\nI am prostrate in the dust,\nI with Christ am crucified.\n\nBorn near Belmont, Maine, on July 4, 1820, McDonald became a local preacher in the Methodist Episcopal Church at the age of 19. After ordination he served in the Maine, Wisconsin, and New England conferences. He edited and published four gospel songbooks between 1940 and 1874.\n\nThe tune, which in unnamed, was composed by William Gustavus Fischer. He also contributed two other tunes, SDAH 318 for the words of “Whiter Than Snow,” and SDAH 457 for the words of “I Love to Tell the Story,” sometimes called HANKEY.\n\nFischer was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on October 14, 1835. He worked as a bookbinder in Philadelphia, studying music in the evenings. Later he taught music at a college in that city from 1858-1868. Then he established a retail piano business with John Edgar Gould (see SDAH 551). He wrote more than 200 gospel songs and was choir conductor and song leader for the evangelistic campaign of Moody and Sankey in 1876, as well as for other revivals. He died on August 12, 1912, at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "Judson VanDeVenter, born December 5, 1855, at Dundee, Michigan, wrote these words in 1896 while at the home of a friend in Florida. VanDeVenter was an art teacher who had visited European art galleries for further study of his specialty. He was also a licensed local preacher of the Methodist Episcopal Church. While singing in the choir one day in Sharon, Pennsylvania, he felt an urge to become an evangelist. It took him five years of struggle with himself to come to a final decision to dedicate himself to Christian service. The words, then, are a reminder of the intense personal struggle and victory. There is one other stanza, the original fourth:\n\n4. All to Jesus I surrender,\nLord I give myself to Thee,\nFill me with Thy love and power,\nLet Thy blessing fall on me.\n\nIn Christ in song, 1908, a suitable text heads the hymn: “Yield yourselves unto God” (Rom. 6:13). The author conducted evangelistic campaigns in the United States and in Great Britain, and later in life in life greatly influenced the young Billy Graham. He died July 17, 1939, at Tampa, Florida.\n\nThe tune was composed by VanDeVenter’s associate in evangelism, Winfield Scott Weeden, of Ohio, and appeared in Gospel Songs of Grace and Glory, 1896. The tenor part in the stanza is a third above the melody, and in the refrain the alto is either a third or a sixth separated from the soprano. The descending passages, the second one note successively lower, and a climax of a complete descending octave. The hymn became very popular because of its frequent use in the Torrey-Alexander missions.\n\nWeeden, born March 29, 1847, at Middleport, Ohio, taught singing school, entered evangelistic work, and solo singer and song leader with VanDeVenter. He also compiled several collections of gospel songs. In later life he owned a small hotel in lower Manhattan, New York, and died July 31, 1908. Appropriately, the words I Surrender All are engraved on his tombstone.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "The recurring theme is “Let us draw near with a true heart” (Heb. 10:22) and “Draw nigh to God” (James 4:8). Other references are: “The Lord God, merciful and gracious” (Ex. 34:6) and “Let him take hold of my strength” (Isa. 27:5).\n\nRobert Harkness, the writer of both words and music, was born in Bendigo, Australia, March 2, 1880, and reared in a Christian home. His father was a well-respected local preacher and town mayor. Robert loved music right from the beginning; he composed his first hymn, tiled “Morning Worship,” at the age of 8. It was published three years later. In 1902 the Torrey-Alexander evangelistic team came to Bendigo. Harkness, who by this time had several years of training and experience as a choir director and organist, played for meetings. He was led to accept Christ by the song leader, Charles Alexander. Joining the evangelistic team, Harkness played for their meetings around the world for several years, writing his gospel songs for use in the meetings. He possessed a great gift for devising unusual (at that time) and beautiful harmonies for his melodies. His skill at the keyboard captured the hearts of everyone. Later he toured with the great preacher J. Wilbur Chapman (see SDAH 187). He made six world tours in the interest of gospel music, giving his special program, “The Music of the cross.”\n\nThe hymns and gospel songs he wrote number about 2,000, including “He Will Hold Me Fast,” “Why Should He Love Me So?” “When the Shadows Flee Away,” “Sometimes,” “When I See My Savior,” “In Jesus,” “Beautiful in the Morning,” and  “What Will It Be to See Jesus?” He was the author of a successful correspondence course, “Evangelistic Piano Playing,” published later in one book by Lillenas Publishing Co.\n\nIn 1959 he was living in Pasadena, California, and was a guest on a special program of the Voice of Prophecy that featured some of his best-known songs.\n\nIn a letter written shortly before his death in London on May 8, 1961, Harkness showed the motivation that sparked the music from his prolific pen: “My Great desire in all my compositions is to send forth in the best musical form the great message of the cross, for the spiritual uplift of that message.”\n\nA number of his songs were included in Gospel in Song  (Review and Herald, 1926).\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "The theme running through this gospel song, “being like Jesus,” is found in 1 peter 2:21. The song was first printed in 1912 in Make Christ King, edited by E. O. Excell William E. Biederwolf. Later it was printed in the SDA Gospel in Song, Review and Herald, 1926.\n\nJames Rowe was born January 1, 1865, in Devon, England. At age 25 he came to the United States and got a job with the railroad in Albany, New York. After a short time as superintendent of the Hudson River Humane Society, he changed to a career in music, writing and editing songs for the Trio, Showalter, and James D. Vaughan (see SDAH 505)  music companies. Making greeting cards.\n\nIt is said that Rowe wrote an incredible 19,000 song poems! This was at a time when gospel songbooks were printed and sold by millions, so it is only natural that a great proportion of the songs would be considered “throw-away” music. “I Would Be Like Jesus” is one of three songs by Rowe that are still in use today, the other two being “I Walk With the King,” and “Love Lifted Me.” Rowe died November 10,1933, at Wells, Vermont.\n\nBentley Deforest Ackley, born September 27, 1872, at Spring Hill, Pennsylvania, was a most gifted child. He learned to play the piano, melodeon, clarinet, cornet, and piccolo in his father’s 14-piece band. In 1888 he went to New York, where he studied stenography; he also played the organ in several churches there in Brooklyn. In 1907 he joined the Billy Sunday evangelistic team as a secretary and as pianist for song leader Homer Rode-heaver. This successful association lasted for eight years, as he wrote new music for choir, solo, and congregation. The Rodeheaver Company employed him as editor; he composed more than 3,000 tunes, and also served as pianist for the popular church music conferences  that Rodeheaver held for many years at Winona Lake, Indiana. Bob Jones University conferred on Ackley the Doctorate of Scared Music degree. He collaborate with his brother, A.H. Ackley (see SDAH 251),a clergyman, in writing many gospel songs. B.D. Ackley died September 3, 1958. Ackley also composed the music for SDAH 426, “I Shall See the King.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "Miss Charlotte Elliott was born on March 18, 1789, at Clapham, Surrey, where she spent her first 32 years. In 1821 she suffered a serious illness, which left her a complete invalid for the rest if her life. The next year Henri Abraham Cesar Malan (1787-1864; see SDAH 330), Swiss preacher and evangelist from Geneva, visited her father’s home. In the course of conversation Charlotte told him she did not know how to find Christ. Malan’s reply was “come to Him just as you are.” Elliott owned her conversation to this statement, and although it was not the immediate cause of her writing this hymn, which dose use the words, “Just as I am, O Lamb of God, I come” in every stanza, the words seem to have lingered a long time in her mind.\n\nShe spent some time in Torquay in her brother’s home, but then moved to Brighton, Sussex, were another brother, Henry Venn Elliot, was a clergyman. He had planned a school where the daughters of the poorer clergyman could be educated at nominal cost, and in 1843 planned a bazaar to raise funds for this project. Charlotte was frustrated by her incapacity to render any physical help in the preparations and spent a wakeful night worrying. Unable to go to the bazaar, she was left alone at home, reliving her worries of the night before. For her own hope and comfort, she wrote the six stanzas of this hymn, under the title “Him that Cometh to Me I Will in No Wise Cast Out” (John 6:37). When her sister- in-law returned home and saw the poem she asked for a copy, and without asking Charlotte’s permission had it printed as a leaflet in 1835. It was included in Charlotte’s The Invalid’s Hymn Book, 1836. She added a seventh stanza (not included in the SDAH) in the same year, in her Hours of Sorrow Cheered and Comforted. Before her conversion Elliott wrote humorous poems, but afterward only poetry and essays on religions subjects.\n\nIn 1834 she accepted the editorship of the Christian Remembrance Pocketbook, and kept that post for 25 years. She seemed to have a special feeling for, and appeal to, those who were ill. She wrote several books and 150 hymns, among them SDAH 603, “Christian, Seek Not Repose.” She died in Brighton on September 22, 1871.\n\nSAFFRON WALDEN was composed by Arthur Henry Brown, who was born July 24, 1830, in Brentwood, not far from Saffron Walden, Essex, England. After a few organ lessons, he was self-taught, at age 11 he became organist of Brentwood Parish Church, a post held for 40 years. In his more than 80 years of playing the organ and directing choirs, mostly in his hometown, he developed an enthusiastic for Gregorian chants and edited a book of organ accompaniments for them. He published the Altar hymnal, containing hymns and introits for the Anglican Eucharistic service. He was also organist for Sir Anthony Brown’s School, and wrote at least 700 hymn tunes. He died February 15, 1926. SAFFRON WARDEN was first printed in Hymnal Companion, where it was with another of Elliott’s texts, “O Holy Savior, Friend Unseen.” English Hymnal, 1906, was the first to match it with “Just as I Am.”\n\nThe SDAH Committee included all stanzas with this tune, realizing that congregations will also have to option of singing these words with the familiar WOODWORTH on facing page.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "This hymn was written on December 9,1769, by William Cowper (1731-1800; see SDAH 107), at a time his friend and companion, Mrs. Mary Unwin, was seriously ill. He wrote in a letter to his aunt the next day that he began to compose the lines before daybreak, but fell asleep after the first two lines. When he awoke, the “third and fourth were whispered to my heart in a way which I have often experienced.” Then in his letter there follow the six stanzas of this hymn, of which SDAH has 1, 4, 3, and 5.\n\nThe hymn was published in the second edition to his friend Richard Conyers’ Collection of Psalms and Hymns, 1772, and then later in 1779 in the Olney Hymns, Book I, No. 111, under the title “Walking With God.” The complete hymn in the original order of stanzas shows a transition from Cowper’s gloom to triumphant climax, somewhat typical of his ups and downs in life. Cowper also wrote SDAH 107, “God Moves in a Mysterious Way,” and SDAH 336, “There Is a Fountain.”\n\nMANOAH is an adaptation made by Henry Wellington Greatorex, appearing in his Church Music, 1851, though the name, the father of Samson (Judges 13: 2), has no related significance. Greatorex was born in Burton-On-Trent, Staffordshire, England, on December 24,1813; he emigrated to the United States in 1838. He had received an early musical training from his father, who was a teacher and composer, and organist at Westminster Abbey. Arriving in Hartford, Connecticut, Greatorex became organist at the Congregational Church there, then later at Protestant Episcopal churches in New York, first St. Paul’s and then Calvary. It was while at the latter church that he published his Church Music, 1851. He moved to Charleston, South Carolina, to another post, but unfortunately contracted yellow fever and died there on September 10, 1858. Greatorex also arranged SDAH 48, SEY-MOUR, and composed SDAH 660, GLORIA PATRIA.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "In the American Dictionary of Hymnology. First Line Index, there are seven cards listing the publication in which the hymn appears. The first is Pentecostal Hymns, No. 3, published by Henry Date in 1902. It is by Frances Ridley Havergal (1836-1879; see biographies) and describes a fully surrendered Christian life and its triumph over doubts and fear. The Old Testament in Hebrew. She is now referring to the statement in Exodus 40:35, “The cloud abode thereon,” for the word abode is the translation of the Hebrew word shakan, from the English word shekinah is transliterated. This “symbol of the abiding presence of Jehovah” (Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 548) is used as an illustration of the abiding presence of Christ in the life of a believer. AURELIA (Golden) was composed in 1864 by Samuel Sabastian Wesley (1810-1876; see SDAH 273). It is so named because it was written for the words of “Jerusalem the Golden,” SDAH 429. It is used also for SDAH 348, “The Church Has One Foundation.” Wesley also composed WETHERBY, SDAH 273, and the unnamed SDAH 691; he harmonized SEELENBRAUTIGAM, SDAH 553.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "James Nicholson wrote these words under the title of “Holiness Desired,” basing them on David’s penitential prayer in Psalm 51; the refrain uses the latter part of verse 7, “Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.” The hymn first appeared in a 16-page pamphlet, Joyful Songs No. 4, 1872.\n\nNicholson was born in 1828 in Ireland and emigrated to the United States about 22 years later, settling in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He became active in Sunday school work and evangelism. He moved to Washington, D.C., in 1871, and worked as a postal clerk. He busied himself in church work, teaching singing and leading singing groups. He became a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and died on November 6, 1876, in Washington D.C. he also wrote SDAH 515, “The Lord Is My Light.”\n\nThe tune, sometimes called WHITER THAN SNOW, was composed in 1872 for these words by William Gustavus Fischer (1835-1912; see SDAH 307).

    "historicalContext": "It is impossible to tell when or how most of the spirituals came into existence. But Miles Mark Fisher, in his Negro Slave Songs in the United States, 1953, tells how this song was born. In 1756, a slave of Hanover, Virginia, went up to William Davies, a Presbyterian minister, with this request: “I come to you, sir, that you may tell me some good things concerning Jesus Christ and my duty to God, for I am resolved not to live anymore as I have done.” He was saying, in other words, “Lord I want to a Christian in my heart.” Fisher goes on to say, “The quiet dignity on the of this song, devoid of the wild abandon of some of the other Negro songs, and the fact that a person had to seek membership in the Christian community, commend this song as a spiritual from a Presbyterian environment. It fits the Virginia ministry if Davies between 1748 and 1759, and is specifically in accord with the slave’s request at Hanover in 1756, the probable place and date of origin.” (There is traditional stanza, which furnishes a stark contrast: “I don’t want to be like Judas!”) This spiritual was first published in Fredrick J. Work’s Folk Songs of the American Negro, Nashville, 1907. One of the first uses in a major denominational hymnal was in Methodist Hymnal, 1964.\n\nThe words echo David’s prayer in Psalm 84:2, “My heart and my flesh in The Story of the Jubilee Singers, 1880, says: “It in a coincidence worthy of tones omitted. The fact that the music of the ancient Greeks is also said to have been written in this scale suggests an interesting inquiry as to whether it may not be a particular language of nature, or a simpler alphabet than the ordinary diatonic scale, in which the uncultivated mind finds its easiest expression.” Notice that the melody of this spiritual is in this mode. The black notes of the piano, starting with G-flat as the tonic, or Do, form this so-called pentatonic scale.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

In 1977 a committee representing the Anglican, Congregational, Methodist, and Presbyterian churches in Australian Hymn Book. They included this consecration hymn, modernizing archaic pronouns. SDAH has used their version, omitting the fourth stanza.\n\nJohn (Jack) Copley Winslow was born August 18, 1882, at Hanworth, Middlesex, England. He was educated at Eton, Balliol (Oxford), and Wells theological college, and was ordained in the Church of England in 1907. After serving as priest in Southwark, as curate of Wimbledon, and as a lecturer at St. Augustine’s College, Canterbury, he went to India in 1914 as a missionary for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. For 19 years he worked in four different cities, and as examining chaplain to the Bishop of Bombay. Back in England in 1936, he has a distinguished career as pastor of Milton, Kent; Beckley, Sussex; and Hanworth churches. He was chaplain at Bryanston School in Dorset for six years, and a t Lee Abbey for 14 years before retirement to Godalming in 1962. He died april 1, 1974. Among a number of books he wrote are the Christian Approach to the Hindu, 1958, and The Dawn OF Indian Freedom,1931.\n\nSLANE is the name of the hill near Tara in County Meath, Ireland; the melody comes from an Irish folk song. The arrangement SDAH uses is by Melvin West (1930-; see Biographies).

    "historicalContext": "These words have attributed to a consecrated Canadian lad, William Ralf Featherstone. The poem was supposed to have been written in 1858, but if that date is correct then he would have been only 12 years old, which hardly seems possible in consideration of the sophisticated language and spiritual concepts in the hymn. Recent research by Leonard Ellinwood, distinguished American hymnologist, reveals a letter from a colleague in London that states the first published form of this hymn is on page 640 of Primitive Methodist Magazine, London, October 1862. In light of this, William would have been 15 or 16 when he wrote the poem. He sent it to his aunt, Mrs. E. Wilson, then living in Los Angeles, who was instrumental in getting it published. According to David J. Beattie, in his The Romance of Sacred Song, London, 1931, “The original copy of the hymn, in the author’s handwriting, is still  a cherished treasure in the family.” It’s first printing in America was in D. L. Moody’s The Northwestern Hymn Book, 1868.\n\nFeatherstone (in some books Featherston) was born July 23, 1846. In Montreal, Canada, and spent his life there. He and his parents were members of the Wesleyan Methodist Church ( now St. James United Church). He died on May 20, 1873.\n\nAdoniram Judson Gordon found the words with a tune in The London Hymn Book, 1864, but marked anonymous. He felt that the tune was unsuitable, so after prayer and meditation he composed this one, which was later named after him. Born April 19, 1836, in New Hampton, New Hampshire, he was educated at Brown University and Newton Theological Seminary. Ordained to the Baptist ministry in 1863, Gordon served first in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, and then in the Clarendon Street Baptist Church, Boston. He edited a monthly, The Watchword, and was the author of a devotional series titled Quiet Talks. He was one of the editors of The Service of Song for Baptist Churches, 1871, and edited The Vestry Hymn and Tune Book, 1872. When evangelist D.L. Moody came to town, Gordon became a good friend and helper in the public meetings. He died in Boston on February 2, 1895.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

He was 4 his mother died, and at age 5 he became separated from his father. By his own efforts he learned to read and write at age 17. Moving to Philadelphia, he went to night school and worked as a hod carrier and church janitor. After finishing a correspondence course from Boston School of Theology, he was ordained to the Methodist ministry; from 1885 to 1902 he served as pastor in Delaware and New Jersey. For three of these years he was the presiding elder of the Wilmington District. The year 1902 found him back in Philadelphia as pastor of Calvary Methodist Episcopal Church. Great crowds of people came to hear his sermons, and the church became known for its ethnic mixture of Blacks, Whites, Italians, Jews, Germans, Norwegians, Mexicans, and Danes.\n\nTindley  wrote both words and music of many gospel songs, including “Stand By Me,” “Leave It There,” “We’ll Understand it Better By and By,” and “I’ll Overcome Someday.” The latter became the basis for “We Shall Overcome,” the theme song of the civil rights movement. We are told that Tindley had a strong influence on, and was greatly admired by, the “Precious Lord, Take My Hand.” Tindley died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on July 26, 1933.\n\nThe arrangement is by Wayne Hooper (1920-; see Biographies).\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Under her nom de plume, Marianne Farningham, Marianne Hearn wrote this hymn for the Voice of Praise, 1887, a book for the Sunday School Union of London. SDAH has omitted her verses 5 and 6.\n\nMarianne Hearn was born December 17, 1834 at Farningham, Kent, England, and was orphaned at an early age. She even had the care of the younger ones on her shoulders. For a time, she taught a primary school in Bristol, then one in Gravesend, and one in Northampton, where she moved in 1865. Throughout her life she wrote articles for magazines and papers, and was on the staff of the Christian World. She also edited the Sunday School Time. Her published works were in several volumes including Songs of Sunshine, Lays and Lyrics of the Blessed Life, and Songs of Joy and Faith. She died March 16, 1909.\n\nJUST AS I AM first appeared with this words in the 1892 Home and School Hymnal. Joseph Barnby (1838 – 1896; see Biographies), a famous English organist in the nineteenth century, composed some 246 hymn tunes, six of which are in SDAH.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "yearWritten": 1824,
    "historicalContext": "This poem appeared over the signature “G” in Sacred Poetry, Edinburgh, 1824, under the title “Lo! We Have Left All and Followed Thee.” It was picked up by James Montgomery in his Christian Psalmist, 1825, and then in two other books without signature. In a slightly different form it appears in Poems, Chiefly Religious, 1833, which was written by Henry Francis Lyte (1793 – 1847; see SDAH 4) and dedicated to Lord Farnham; Lady Farnham, who died just before publication, had suggested that Lyte’s poems be printed. The hymn appears under the same title, which is a quotation in Mark 10:28 and consists of six stanzas of eight lines each.\n\nThe theme of the hymn fits the experience of Anne Maxwell, daughter of an Anglican clergyman, who was forced to leave her home because she joined the Methodist Church. Later she married Lyte, an Anglican curate! Lyte also wrote SDAH 4, “Praise, My Soul, the King of Heaven”; SDAH 25, “Praise the Lord, His Glories Show”; and SDAH 50 “Abide With Me.”\n\nELLESDIE is said to come from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791). Is was published in 1831 with two parts only, a melody and a bass; Hubert Platt Main (see SDAH36) completed the harmony in 1873. ELLESIDIE is also uses for SDAH 621, “Gracious Father, Guard Thy Children.” Main also arranged SDAH 36, BELOVED, and composed SDAH 456, “My Lord and I.”\n\nMozart was born January 27, 1756, at Salzburgh, Astria, with the full name Joannes Chrysostomus Wolfgang Theophilus. On the certigicate his father wrote Gottlieb (beloved of God), instead of Theophilus, which finally was charged to the Latin form Amadeus. In private life he was always called Wolfgang, Recognized as one of the greatest musical geniuses of the Western world, he began learning harpsichord and piano at the age of 3 from his father and sister; at age 6 he made a concert tour with them to Munich and Vienna. People were astounded at his ability to improvises, and “all the ladies lost their hearts to the little fellow.” The next year they tool a longer trip through Germany and Belgium to Paris, where they stayed five months. They went on to London and triumphant concert for royalty. The king put before Wolfgang pieces by J.C. Bach, Able, and Handel, which he played perfectly at sight. Throughout his life he was widely feted as a performer, composer, and conductor, but somehow never achieved financial security. He died December 5, 1791, in Vienna, Austria, at the young age of 35. And was buried in a pauper’s grave. Kochel’s catalog of Mozart’s compositions records some 600 works, very few of which were published in his lifetime, but were circulated freely in manuscript form. Almost all of his vast output has been preserved, however, in the edition published by Breitkopf  and Hartel. The catalog includes operas; all kinds of church music for organ, choir, and instruments; solo arias with orchestra; a cappela vocal music; songs with piano; concerts for violin and piano with orchestra at least 41 symphonies; chamber music and works for piano and harpsichords. Starting with a piano work at age 4, his life was consumed with music and composition, ending with the beautiful Requiem, which was unfinished at his death. For the most part, his creative process was completed in his mind before putting pen to paper. His thoughts were always occupied with music. He once wrote to his father, “You know that I am, so to speak, swallowed up in music, that I am busy with it all day, speculating, studying, considering.” Mozart cannot really be considered a hymn tune composer, as all the ones credited to him have been adapted from his other works.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

Her communiques to me were always left on the piano or on my violin case. One Sunday morning, she placed on the piano a little poem by Mrs. Rhea F. Miller. Mother thought its message beautiful. I did, too. Instead of practicing the hymn I had intended to play that Sunday morning in church, I turned to this poem. Melody just seemed to form around the words. When I played and sang it through for the first time, Mother came in from the kitchen where she had overheard. She wrapped both arms around my shoulders and placed her wet cheek net to mine. In church that morning, I sang for the first time, ‘I’d Rather Have Jesus.’”\n\nNo information is available about Mrs. Rhea F. Miller.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "yearWritten": 1693,
    "historicalContext": "This hymn is an extensive modification of one written by Thomas Shepherd and printed in Penitential Cries, 1693. Born March 9, 1665, England, Shepherd was a minister of the Church of England and followed his father into the Congregational Church in 1698, ministering in Northampton and in Essex. In Bocking, Essex, he served for almost 40 years and died January 29, 1739. The full poem is entitled “For Universal Obedience,” and consist of five stanzas. It has since been considerably altered. Alterations have been attributed to G. N. Allen, who wrote the tune, and to Charles Beecher (1815-1900), a Congregational minister of Litchfield, Connecticut, and brother of the Famous Henry Ward Beecher.\n\nMAITLAND was composed in 1844 by George Nelson Allen especially for these words and was printed in Oberlin Social and Sabbath School Hymn Book, 1844. With the exception of the passing note of C, the second note in lines 1 and 3, the melody is written in the pentatonic (five-note) scale.  The melody of “Precious Lord, Take My Hand” is almost exactly the same as this. Allen was born on September 7, 1812, at Mansfield, Ohio. He graduated from Oberlin College in 1838 and stayed on as a faculty member, teaching music and geology. He instituted the choral and instrumental programs of music education that finally developed into the Oberlin Conservatory of Music. He retired in 1865 and died 12 years later in Cincinnati, Ohio, on December 9, 1877.\n\nThe tune is named CROSS AND CROWN in Beecher’s Collection, 1855.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "yearWritten": 1874,
    "historicalContext": "In late January and early February, 1874, Frances Ridley Havergal (1836-1879; see Biographies) paid a five-day visit to Areley House, London, where 10 other persons were staying. All of them were either unconverted or unhappy, and Havergal was impressed to pray for them so that they might all experience the joy of Christian living. Her prayer was, “Lord, give me all in this house.” The night before her departure, February 4, only two young women had not surrendered their will to the Lord, but after a personal visit from Havergal, they too trusted and rejoiced. By that time it was early midnight, but the answer to her prayer made her so happy that she could not sleep. She spent most of the night in praise and reconsecration of her own life, and these couplets, eleven of them, formed in her mind. They were published in her Loyal Responses 1878, but a twelfth couplet appeared in Charles B. Snepp’s Song of Grace and Glory, 1874, appendix, which makes the hymn now 12 stanzas of two lines each, suitable for six-stanza, four-line hymn of meter 7.7.7.7. Havergal had assisted Snepp in compiling his 1872 edition, which contained some of her poems, so the twelfth couplet is presumably her own composition. The two couplets omitted in SDAH are Nos. 2 and 8. In SDAH, stanza 4, line 3, the word is is italicized in the original, and in stanza 5, line 4, only is in italics and all is in capitals.\n\nHavergal’s own title for the hymn was “Self-consecration to Christ,” based on the statement by the humble Mephibosheth, “Yea, let him take all” (2Sam. 19:30). Later, Havergal wrote concerning the hymn: “That couplet, ’Take my silver and my gold, Not a mite would I withhold,’ does not mean that because we have 10 shillings in our purse, we are pledged to put it all into the next collecting plate, else we should have none for the next call! But it does mean that every shilling is to be, and I think I may say is, held at my Lord’s disposal, and is distinctly not my own.” The whole hymn can be summed up in the words of our Lord Himself in His reply to the lawyer’s question about the great commandment: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind” (Matt.22:37).\n\nThe hymn was invariably sung by her father’s tune PATMOS, and it was hoped that, as in early publications associated with Havergal, this tune and her words would be associated. However, there have been other tunes, the particular one in SDAH being HENDON, composed by Henri Abraham Cesar Malan. Born in Geneva, Switzerland, on July 7, 1787, he became a brilliant preacher in the Reformed Church. He built a chapel on his own property and preached there 43 years, and composed more than 1,000 hymn tunes and texts. He lived for some time in London, of which Hendon is a northern suburb, and died in Switzerland on May 18, 1864. Malan is considered one of the great names in the history of French hymns.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "John Ernest Bode was rector of Castle Camps, near Cambridge, England, at the time when his three children, a daughter and two sons, were confirmed as communicants in the Church of England. For their confirmation service he wrote a special hymn, “O Jesus, We Have Promised,” which was printed in 1868 in a leaflet titled “Hymn for the Newly Confirmed.” There were six stanzas.\n\nBode was born in St. Pancras, Middlesex, England, on February 23, 1816. He was educated at Eton and Charterhouse, and then went to Oxford, where he gained a B. A. in 1837 and a M. A. in 1840. He was a tutor and examiner for his college, Christ Church, from 1827 to 1843. He was ordained in the early 1840s, and in 1847 was appointed as a rector of Westwell, a small village near Oxford. From there he was transferred in 1860 to Castle Camps, where he ministered until his death on October 6, 1874. He published Hymns for the Gospel of the Day in 1860, and Short Occasional Poems in 1858.\n\nANGEL’S STORY is so named because it was expressly composed in 1881, by Arthur Henry Mann, for the words of Emily Huntington Miller’s hymn, “I Love to Hear the Story Which Angel Voices Tell.” Mann was born in Norwich, Norfolk, England, on May 16, 1850. As a boy, he was a chorister in the cathedral in that city. Later he became assistant organist and then studied at Oxford University, where he gained the B. Mus. degree in 1874 and the D. Mus. in 1882. He was appointed organist at St. Peter’s Church in Wolverhampton in 1870, and from 1871 to 1875 was organist at nearby Tettenhall. In 1875 he was organist at Beverley Minster, near Hull in Yorkshire. The next year he became organist and choirmaster at King’s College, Cambridge, serving there until his death at Cambridge on November 19, 1929. Mann composed an oratorio, several hymn tunes, organ pieces, and anthems. He was a collector of early hymnbooks, specialized in Handel and his original manuscripts, and was editor of the Hymnal of the Church of England in 1895.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "This hymn poem, written by Phoebe Palmer (1807-1874), relates the cleansing of sin by Jesus’ blood to the act of being baptized by water and the beginning of a new life in Christ. She bases the words of the refrain on 1 john 1:7: “The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.”\n\nMrs. Phoebe Palmer, of Boston, Massachusetts, and later of New York, was a Methodist who was converted to the Millerite doctrine of the Second Advent by Charles Fitch prior to 1844. The latter was particularly afraid that he would lose the friendship of Mrs. Palmer and her evangelist husband, Dr. Walter C. Palmer, because of the unpopular doctrine he was preaching. Mrs. Palmer survived the disappointment of 1844 and later wrote SDAH 598, “Watch, Ye Saints.”\n\nThe tune, sometimes called CLEANSING WAVE, was composed by her daughter and namesake, Phoebe Palmer, who was born March 9, 1839, in New York City and showed great musical talent at an early age. At 16 she married Joseph F. Knapp, a Christian businessman who later founded the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company of New York. They became active members of the John Street Methodist Church, where she was a singer and organist. Mrs. Knapp collaborated in song writing with Fanny Crosby, who was also a member there. Knapp died in 1891, leaving his wife an annual income of $50,000, a good portion of which she gave to charitable causes. In her beautiful apartment in New York’s Hotel Savoy, she had installed the largest pipe organ to be in a private home up to that time. Her son, Joseph, turn out to be a famous as the head of Crowell-Collier Publishing Company. She composed more than 500 gospel songs, including the favorite solo “Open the Gates of the Temple,” the words of which were written by her good friend, Fanny Crosby. Together they also wrote SDAH 462. “Blessed Assurance.” Phoebe Palmer-Knapp died at Poland Springs, Maine, on July 10, 1908.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "These words were written by Robert Robinson in 1758 while he was the preacher at a Calvinistic Methodist church in Mildenhall, Suffolk, England. It expresses his own feelings after his conversion three years previously. Robinson was born in Swaffham, Norfolk, England, on September 27, 1735. When he was 8 years old, the family moved to Scarning, a small town nine miles to the east. His father died shortly after, and the family was left in poor circumstances. His mother wanted him to train for the ministry of the Anglican Church, but they had no money for the expense of study. So when he was14 years old Robinson was apprenticed to a barber in London, but he spent much time in reading and lived a careless life. When he was 17, his conscience was awakened after hearing a sermon by George Whitefield, but he was not really converted until three years after. He continued to attend services conducted by Wesley and others, and in 1758 he was invited to be a preach at a Calvinistic Methodist Church in Mildenhall. Shortly after this, he moved to Norwich and establish an independent congregation. In 1759 there was a vacancy in a Baptist church at Cambridge, and he was invited to be a preacher there. He was baptized by immersion and was so much liked in the church that he was urged to become the pastor, even though he was untrained. In 1761 he accepted this responsibility but managed a farm to balance his expenses. Though uneducated in the schools, he learned French and Latin and wrote four books that were very acceptable to his contemporary preachers. He was an eloquent orator and often wrote hymns to conclude his sermons. He retired to Birmingham in 1790 and died there on June 9 of that year at Showell Green.\n\nNETTLETON is named for Asahel Nettleton of Connecticut, who was an itinerant evangelist but not a composer. He was a Yale graduate (1809) and became a preacher for the Congregational Church. He compiled Village Hymns, 1824, which contained no tunes. The composer of the tune could have been John Wyeth, who included this tune, named HALLELUJAH in his Supplement to the Repository of Sacred Music, 1813. The Repository itself was published in 1810. Wyeth, born March 31, 1770, at Cambridge, Massachusetts, was not only a printer but also a music publisher and a musician. He was appointed postmaster of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, by George Washington and edited a Federalist paper, Oracle of Dauphine, for 35 years. He died January 23, 1858, at Philadephia. NETTLETON is a very simple AABA tune, for the first score is repeated in the second and again in the fourth.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "William Cowper (1731-1800; see SDAH 107) wrote this hymn of seven stanzas in 1770, after an attack of temporary insanity. It appeared in Richard Conyers’ in Collection of Psalm and Hymns, 1772, and then later as No. LXXIX in Olney Hymns, 1779. The last half of the sec0nd stanza as originally written shows Cowper’s recovery from his illness and his supreme confidence in God’s saving power. His words are in the past tense and express his spiritual experience at the time:\n\nAnd there have I, as vile as he,\nWash’d all my sins away.\n\nA change in the last line from “I’ll sing... when this... tongue lies silent in the grave” was made to accord with the doctrine of the unconscious sleep of death before the resurrection. Stanza 6 is Cowper’s fifth, and stanza 5 is his sixth, which mentions the “golden harp” and thus leads naturally into the omitted stanza, which is:\n\n‘Tis strung, and tun’d, for endless years,\nAnd form’d by power divine;\nTo sound in God the Father’s ears\nNo other name but Thine.\n\nThe title of the hymn was “Praise for the Fountain Opened,” which is based on the words “There shall be a fountain opened... for sin and for uncleanness” (Zech. 13:1). Cowper also wrote SDAH107, “God Moves in Mysterious Way,” and SDAH 315, “O for a Closer Walk!)\n\nCLEANSING FOUNTAIN, an early American pentatonic melody, uses only 5 notes of the ordinary eight-note scale. If transposed to the correct key, it can be played entirely on the black notes of the piano. Pentatonic tunes omit the fourth and seventh notes of the well-known octave and are typical of many Scottish airs, e.g., “Loch Lomond.” They are also common in African melodies and hence in tunes used by, and popular among, North American negroes, for example: “Nobody knows the trouble I see.” Examples of such tunes in SDAH are BRADBURY, No. 190; I LOVE THEE, No. 236; and the unnamed tune for No. 279\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

Kirkpatrick’s tune (see SDAH 337) in Songs of Redeeming Love, 1882, edited by John R. Sweney, C. C. McCabe, T. C. O’Kane, and Kirkpatrick. By placing these two stings of the song on facing pages, it is possible to sing any combination of the five stanzas with either tune.\n\nADA was composed by Aubrey Lee (“Pete”) Butler (1933-; see SDAH 193), a Baptist minister of music at ADA, Oklahoma (hence the tune name). It was introduced by the Singing Churchmen of Oklahoma at the Southern Baptist Convention held in 1966 at Detroit, Michigan. William J. Reynolds, musical editor of Baptist Hymnal, 1975, heard this performance and called the composer at once to make arrangements for its publication. As a mixed voice anthem it was published in The Church Musician, and used by Cliff Barrows, director of the huge choirs in the Billy Graham crusades. A delightfully singable hymn tune, it has been included in Crusade Hymns, Nashville, 1968; Hymns for the Living Church, Hope Publishing Company, 1982; Baptist Hymnal, Nashville, 1975.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "This free paraphrase of part of Psalm 27 appears in James Montgomery’s (1771-1854; see Biographies) Imitations of Psalms, 1822. He actually wrote two paraphrases, the first in seven stanzas of four lines each, beginning “One thing, with all my souls’ desire” (Ps. 27:4), and this one in two stanzas of eight lines each. In Montgomery’s later publication, Original Hymns, 1853, he gave it the title “Trust in the Lord.”\n\nWEI LIEBLICH IST DER MAIEN (How Lovely Is the May) was a secular song to the words “Mit Lieb bin ich umfangen” (With Love I Am surrounded) and appears in Johann Steurlein’s Gesitliche Lieder (Spiritual Songs), 1575. Steurlein was born in 1546 in the town of Schmalkalden in the Thuringian Forest area. He studied law and was appointed town clerk of nearby Wasungen, where he knew and encouraged the talented Melchior Vulpius (see SDAH 173). In 1589 he moved to Meiningen, where he was a notary public and later mayor of the city. Steurlein was a notable poet and rhymed the Old and New Testaments in German, for which he was honored by Emperor Rudolph II. He was also a composer and produced melodies and four-part harmonies; three of his hymn texts appear in his volume of 27 four-part spiritual songs, published in 1588. He died at Meiningen in 1613. Healy Willan’s best-selling anthem using this tune was published in 1954 by concord is Publishing House, with the Thanksgiving text “Sing to the Lord of Harvest.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "This hymn was created for a New Year’s Day service, 1978, by Brian Wren (1936-; see Biographies) while he was a pastor of Holy Family Church, Blackbird Leys, Oxford, England. In his book Faith Looking Forward, 1983, the author gives us this insight into why he wrote the hymn:\n\n“In itself, the new year is an arbitrary convention, its ‘newness’ a mere mark on the calendar. The recurrent awakening of life in nature is not a strong enough foundation for hope of real change. Yet by faith in the really new events of the Christian story, a day, or a month, or an hour can become charged with promise, and be a springboard to a changed life.” Reading of the text will indicate that this hymn can be used on any occasion of a new beginning, or starting over.\n\nBrian Wren composed the melody of the tune DRONFIELD, and his good friend, Peter Cutts (1937-; see Biographies), arranged it for the book Faith Looking Forward, Hope Publishing Company, 1983. Dronfield is a town six miles south of Sheffield, Yorkshire, England.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "yearWritten": 1876,
    "historicalContext": "The words of this hymn were found with other manuscripts in Philip Bliss’s trunk, which survived the train wreck at Ashtabula, Ohio, that took his life (see SDAH 286). James McGranahan (1840-1907) wrote the music for these words while he was on a trip to Chicago. He arranged to have it sung for the first time, by a quartet of male voices, at the Chicago tabernacle meetings. The relating of the circumstances under which the words were found added interest to the words themselves, a dying testimony, as it were, of Bliss’s personal faith.\n\nGeorge C. Stebbins (1846-1945; see Biographies), one of the quartet to first sing the song, tells how he later recorded it: “I had been singing a great deal in New England, and near the close of our meetings in one city, an Edison phonograph- the most startling invention of that age- was being exhibited. It was suggested that if I could be secured to sing into it and the fact made known in the community, it might serve to bring a larger number of people to the entertainment. I was accordingly invited ‘to make a record’ as it is now called, which I did in the hall where the meetings had recently been held, and the selection I chose was ‘I Will Sing of My Redeemer.’ The record was made on a cylinder wrapped in tinfoil, which was turned by hand both in recording and in reproducing, as the mechanical device now in use had not been provided at that time, and when it was made, I stepped aside and heard myself sing. I remember... the novel experience, as I had never seen a phonograph before, and the hearing of my own voice, and every word with striking distinctness enunciated, and even my characteristic manner of singing, modulation of voice and phrasing, produced a unique sensation’’ (Reminiscences and Gospel Hymn Stories).\n\nThis combination of words and music was first printed in Welcome Tidings, A New Collection for Sunday School, 1877, compiled by Robert Lowry (see SDAH 422), William H. Doane (see Biographies), and Ira D. Sankey (see Biographies). The next year McGranahan published the male voice arrangement in his Gospel Male Choir. For further comments on James McGranahan, see SDAH 195.\n\nThe original refrain of McGranahan’s music was in a meter of 12/8, and involved many more repeated notes and words in the tenor and bass. The SDAH committee elected to use this shorter, simpler version that keeps the 9/8 meter throughout.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "The New Englanders did not use to any great extent the psalm versions by Isaac Watts until after the American Revolution. They felt Watts made too much of a patriotic Englishman out of David. Also the Psalter then in use was that of Joel Barlow, who had fallen into immortality, and they could not in good conscience sing his poetry. This version of portions of Psalm 137 was made by Timothy Dwight while he was president of Yale University. The General Association of Congregationalists and the Presbyterian General Assembly had joined in requesting Dwight to revise Watts’s The Psalms of David Imitated, in a way that they could enjoy singing. His collection became known as “Dwight’s Watts.’’ This hymn is neither a translation nor a paraphrase of the psalm, but he uses an idea from verses to5 and 6.\n\nIn the four stanzas SDAH uses, the committee changed “Thee” and “Thou” to “You” and “Your.”\n\nBorn May 14, 1752, at Northampton, Massachusettes, Timothy Dwight was early taught by his mother, A most precocious child, he could read the Bible at 4; by the time he was 13 he had already completed most of the work for the first two years of college, so he entered Yale University. Graduating with honors in 1769, he held these post in succession: grammar school teacher; tutor at Yale; chaplain in the American Army, where he became a friend of George Washington; farmer; preacher; representative in the state legislature; and pastor of the Congregational church in Fairfield, Connecticut. St age 43 he became president of Yale University; he also taught ethics, metaphysics, logic, literature, oratory, and theology. As college chaplain, he gave a series of chapel sermons—“Theology Explained and Defended”—that did much to raise the moral and religious tone of the campus. Almost one third of the student body accepted Christianity in this revival.\n\nST. THOMAS is a portion of a much longer tune, HOLBORN, which was the setting for Wesley’s “Soldiers of Christ, Arise” in Aaron William’s The Universal Psalmodist, 1763. In the 1770 edition this shortened version was printed and called ST. THOMAS. An American edition of this book was published by Daniel Bailey at Newburyport, Massachusetts, in 1769, under the title The American Harmony.\n\nAaron Williams (1731-1776) was probably born in London. He was an engraver and publisher of music, taught music at West Smithfield, and was clerk of the Scottish Church, London Wall. In addition to the book above, he composed some of the music for the edited several collections of church music including The Royal Harmony, 1766; Harmonia Celestis (Harmony of Heaven), 1775; and Psalmody in Miniature, 1778. ST. THOMAS is also used for SDAH 372.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "historicalContext": "This was written by George Briggs for Songs of Praise, 1933, to go with another Bach tune, RINKART (KOMMT SEELEN), which has a wide range, an octave and a half, making it difficult for congregational use.\n\nGeorge Wallace Briggs (1875-1959; see SDAH 261 was a minister, musician, and educator the Church of England; he furnished eight tunes and 16 texts for Songs of Praise, 1933. He also wrote SDAH 261, “The Spirit of the Lord Revealed,” and SDAH 413, “God Has Spoken by His Prophets.”\n\nDARMSTADT (O GOTT, DU FROMMER GOTT, O God, Thou Faithful God) first appeared in Fritsch’s Himmels-Lust und Welt-Unlust (Desire of Heaven and Dislike for Earth), 1679. The tune name comes from the fact that this tune appeared in a hymnbook in Darmstadt, Germany, in 1689. (The German SDA Seminary is situated in the outskirts of this city.) There have been many different melodic versions of this, one of the finest stately and most stately of the German chorales. The arrangement SDAH uses is slightly altered   from the final chorus of Bach’s Cantata No. 94, “Was frag’ ich nach der Welt (What Do I Care for the World). He also used it in Cantatas 45, 64, and 133.\n\nAhasuerus Fritsch was born December 16, 1629, in Mücheln, Saxony, Germany, the eight of 11 children, in the house of the town mayor. His childhood was during the Thirty Years’ War, and the family suffered when the town was besieged. In spite of poverty brought about by the death of his father when Ahasuerus was only 14, somehow he managed to get an education, and went to study at Jena in 1650. Becoming a tutor in a wealthy family, he earned their respect, and they supported him in completing his Doctor of Law degree at the University of Jena in 1661. He later served as chancellor of the university and as president of the consistory of Rudolstadt. A prolific writer on antiquarian, legal, and sacred subjects, he made collections of hymns, carefully naming all the authors, but modestly leaving off his name from his own works. He died at Rudolstadt August 24, 1701.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

Of the 107 new texts submitted, this one was chosen and published in Ten New Hymns on the Ministry.\n\nErnest Alexander Payne was born February 19, 1902, in Hackney, London, England. After he spent four years as minister of Bugbrooke Baptist Church, his career embraced a variety of posts: secretary of the young people’s department; editorial secretary for the Baptist Missionary Society; moderator of the Free Church Federal Council; general secretary of the Baptist Union; vice president of the Baptist World Alliance; and president of the World Council of Churches.

After graduation from Baylor and Old Dominion universities he taught theory, arranging, and trumpet at the U.S. Navy School of Music. For a number of years he served as minister of music in Texas and Virginia churches, then he became director of music publications for Word Music, Inc., of Waco, Texas.

    "historicalContext": "This Danish Lutheran hymn was written by Nikolai Grundvig and first appeared in Sang-vark iill den danske kirke (Song-work for the Danish Church), published in Copenhagen in 1837. Carl Doving made the English translation in 1909. For the Lutheran Service Book and Hymnal, 1959, Fred C. M. Hansen condensed the original seven stanzas to five and made some alterations. SDAH uses stanzas 1, 2, and 3.\n\nNikolai Frederick Severin Grundvig was born September 8, 1783, the son of a Lutheran pastor in Udby, Denmark. He graduated from the University of Copenhagen in 1803. For a time he was a teacher in a school for boys, and began to write poetry in earnest. When his father became ill, he was called to take the pulpit but because of his radical views regarding a theological controversy, it was 10 years before he was really accepted as a pastor. He became popular as a preacher and hymnwriter, and because of his efforts to raise the intellectual standard of the Danish people, he is known as the “father of the public school” in Scandinavia. On the occasion of his fiftieth anniversary as a pastor, many officials of the church and state from all the Scandinavian countries came to pay him tribute. He died September 2, 1872.\n\nCarl Doving, born March 21, 1867, at Norddalen, Norway, immigrated to the United States at age 23 and trained for the Lutheran ministry at Trinity Seminary, Blair, Nebraska, he was ordained and served churches in Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois. He was president of the Iowa district, 1939-1943, and of the Illinois district, 1944-1948. A member of the committee for the Lutheran Service Book and Hymnal, 1958, he contributed a number of translations and original hymns. After retirement to his home at Blair, he died April 4, 1965.\n\nKIRKEN DEN ER ET GAMMELT HUS means literally “Church it is an old house.” The strong minor tune was written by Lindeman for this poem in 1840 and printed that year in Wilhelm Wexel’s Christelige Psalmer. Ludvig, a musical prodigy as a child, studied with his father, who was a successful concert pianist in Trondheim, Norway. At age 12 he substituted on the organ in the church where his father played for 57 years. When he went to Oslo to study theology, he often played in Vor Frelsers Kirke, the church where his brother was organist. It was here that he served for 27 years with Pastor Wilhelm A. Wexels. They had a longstanding feud involving the pastor’s sermons, which were too long, and the organist’s improvisations, which tend to dominate the service!\n\nWith his son Peter, Lindeman founded the Oslo Conservatory in 1883, the first music conservatory of its kind in Norway. He published a large volume of organ music, a book of chorale melodies for hymns, and a volume of organ music, a book of chorale melodies for hymns, and a collection of some 2,500 folk melodies.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Bishop John William Colenso (1814-1883) of Natal, South Africa, wrote a book entitled The Pentateuch and the Book of Joshua, Critically Examined. In it he revealed his support for the “modern” disbelief in the historicity of these Old Testament accounts and also his liberal views of the Scriptures and some of the doctrines of the Anglican Church. His superior, Bishop Gray, of Cape Town, declared Colenso deposed from his bishopric because of his divisive opinions. Colenso appealed to the Privy Council and was reinstated as bishop in Natal; he continued to hold his “higher critical” views until his death. A furor was created in the church and bitter debate resulted.\n\nIn the town of Windsor, in Berkshire, England, a young curate, Samuel John Stone, was thrilled by Bishop Gray’s defense of the faith. He knew that the poorer and uneducated members of his congregation, although reciting the creed faithfully each week, did not fully understand its real meaning. He decided to strengthen the faith of his own parishioners by writing a hymns to explain the creed. These hymns—12 in all, one for each article of the Apostle’s Creed—were printed in his Lyra Fidelium, 1866. In the preface Stone states: “The testimony of Holy Scripture has also been adduced to authorize the doctrine and sentiment of almost every line, and to shew the oneness of the truth of the Bible and the belief of the Church.”\n\nThis hymn is based on article nine of the creed, which states: “I believe in... the holy catholic church, the communion of saints.” Reference to the Colenso controversy is seen in SDAH’s third stanza, lines three and four, which are even stronger in the original, namely:\n\nBy schisms rent asunder,\n\nBy heresies distrest,\n\nThere were originally seven stanzas, of which SDAH has 1, 2, 4, and 5. In 1885 the hymn was enlarged by the addition of three more stanzas, for processional use in Salisbury Cathedral; they appear in Stone’s Hymns, 1886, headed “Full Form.”\n\nThe hymn is truly an instructive one, as intended, and fulfilled the purpose of the author, who said in his preface that there were many prose expositions of the creed that were mainly for students and educated persons. He felt that a poetical form of the articles would be more effectual in keeping them in the memory and influencing the heart and life of those who sang.\n\nStone, born on April 25, 1839, at Whitmore, Staffordshire, graduated from Oxford University. He was ordained in 1862 and appointed to Windshor as curate. In 1870 he transferred to London as assistant to his father, and in 1874 succeeded him as vicar. From 1890 until his death on November 19, 1900, he ministered in central London, taking particular care of young people who commuted in to London each day to work. He made his church a haven for them so that they would not have to walk the streets until their places of work opened. He composed more than 50 hymns.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "historicalContext": "This hymn recalls these words from 1 John 4:7, 8: “Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.”\n\nThe text is a translation, by James Quinn, of the Latin hymn “Ubi Caritas,” traditionally associated with the celebration of Maunday Thursday (a commemoration of the events of the Last Supper). Historically, liturgical books offered it as a song to be sung during the washing of the feet, a rite that took place in this Maunday Thursday service between the reading of John 13:1-15 and the offertory. While most churches have long since discontinued the symbolic washing of feet, Seventh-day Adventist gain a great blessing from following Christ’s example in this “ordinance of humility.” Thus this hymn (1) is a song intimately connected with the celebration of and reflection on the Lord’s last supper; (2) focuses our attention on Christ’s words in the course of that supper, when He gave His new law of love (the Latin for “new law” is mandatum novum; the English word “Maunday” is derived from mandatum); (3) has been closely associated with the powerful ordinance that reenacts Christ’s gesture of love as service, i.e., the washing of feet.\n\nJames Quinn was born April 21, 1919, at Glasgow, Scotland, and educated there at St. Aloysius’ College and at the University of Glasgow. Later he studied philosophy at Heythrop College, Oxfordshire, England, and was ordained a Catholic priest in 1950. He has served in a number of churches and as a teacher in several colleges; in addition, his keen interest in the unity of the churches has led to at least 10 appointments on national and international bodies working toward that end. Besides two volumes of hymns, he has written articles, reviews, and pamphlets on theological and doctrinal subjects, including articles in the New Catholic Encyclopedia. Throughout his career he sought to make more opportunities in the church service for people to sing meaningful hymns, rather than just to sit in the pews and be entertained by the clergy. Therefore, many of his hymns were born out of a need to fill gaps in subject matter, yet Quinn sought to keep them true to Scripture. He sometimes dispensed with the fetters of rhyme, but always achieved a direct and forceful expression. With the help of a musical friend who was headmaster of a primary school, he often tried out his texts on children, to see if they could be easily understood and had suitability for singing. He has thus made a strong contribution to modern hymnody.\n\nUBI CARITAS (Where Affection [Is] first was used in the Westminster Hymnal, 1940, made for the Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral at Westminster (not to be confused with Westminster Abbey which is Anglican). This is one of Murray’s singable melodies that has found its way into many other hymnals.\n\nAnthony Gregory Murray was born February 27, 1905, in Fulham, London. He sang in the Westminster Cathedral Choir School at 9. And soon became assistant organist to Sir Richard Terry (see SDAH 364). At 17 he was made a Fellow of the Royal College of Organists. After study at Christ’s College, Cambridge, he was ordained a priest in 1932, and became organist at Downside Abbey. During his work as parish priest in several places, he made a significant contribution to hymnody, liturgical music, and organ literature. He was assistant editor of a number of Catholic hymnbooks from 1966 to 1973. He was the musical consultant in the preparation of the Grail version of the Gelineau Psalms, to which he contributed several antiphons. Twelve of his tunes and arrangements appear in The Australian Hymn Book, 1977.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "This hymn by John Fawcett (1740-1817; see SDAH 64) appears as No. 104 in his Hymns Adapted to the Circumstances of Public Worship and Private Devotion, published in Leeds, England, in 1782. It was entitled “Brotherly Love” and had two other stanzas. His book was written from Brearley Hall, near Halifax, where he was the pastor of a Baptist congregation at Wainsgate in 1765. He had endeared himself so greatly to his flock that when a call came to him in 1772 to accept a more auspicious appointment in London, he hesitated. However, he had a large family to support and finally decided to transfer. After his farewell sermon, his congregation begged him to remain with them. The next morning the furniture was loaded onto the wagons, but at the last moment of pleas of his flock prevailed on him and his wife to the extent that they unloaded the furniture and refused the appointment, staying on in his parish in Yorkshire.\n\nDENNIS is an arrangement of a tune brought back from Europe by Lowell Mason (1792-1872; see Biographies), and published in his and George J. Webb’s (see SDAH 618) The Psalter, 1845. Mason credited Hans (Johann) George Naegeli, of Zurich, Switzerland, with the tune, but omitted to state the particular source. Leonard Ellinwood suggests it might have been from his Christliches Gesangbuch (Christian Hymnbook) 1828, which has a tune almost identical in the first half’ as DENNIS. Naegeli was born May 26, 1768, in Wetzikon, now a suburb of Zurich. He established a music publishing business there. He composed vocal and instrumental works and taught music according to the principles of his contemporary fellow citizen and educational reformer, Johann Pestaöozzi. Naegeli died in his hometown on December 26, 1836.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "historicalContext": "The first publication of this hymn was in the 1889 supplement to Hymns Ancient and Modern. The hymn recalls Ephesians 4: 4-6: “There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of  your  calling; one Lord, one  faith, one baptism, one God and Father  of  all, who is above all, and through all, and in you  all.’’\n\nEdward Hayes Plumptre (1821-1891) was a minister of the Church of England. He is best known for SDAH 27, “Rejoice, Ye Pure Heart!” (see this hymn for further comment).\n\nTHORNBURY was composed for these words and was used at the twenty-fifth annual festival of the London Church Choir Association on November 17, 1898. It was printed in the festival booklet, and in 1905 in the composer’s Hymn Tunes Original and Selected.\n\nBasil Hardwood (1859-1949; see SDAH 9) is known for writing tunes that are wide-ranging in unison melody; many of them were written to be sung by large congregations. While this one has a few melodic leaps of a fifth or a sixth, and one octave leap, yet they all use the notes of the chords. The persevering will find a rich reward when the tune is learned and sung with vigor and confidence.\n\nHardwood named many of his tunes after towns in the western country of England. This one, for example, commemorates the small town of Thornbury, north of Bristol.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

At the Royal Irish Academy of Music he studied piano, organ, harmony and counterpoint, double bass, and voice production. Later he taught at the academy. After serving as organist in various churches, he became organist-choirmaster at the Dublin Christ Church Cathedral, where he stayed for 30 years. He found his greatest personal enjoyment in The Strollers, a Dublin singing club more than 100 years old, the directorship of which he held from 1928 until his death in 1966. He wrote many anthems, hymn arrangements, and service music.

    "historicalContext": "The title of this hymn by Fred Kaan (1929-; see Biographies) is “Work and Worship,” showing the close relation between factors that often are considered to be unrelated. It was written in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1970, to be sung at the regular meeting of staff members of organizations that had their headquarters in the Ecumenical Center there. It was the custom that start the working week each Monday morning with an ecumenical worship service; on June 8, 1970, the theme for consideration was “Questions From a Reading Worker.” Kaan’s original words reflected the particular duties associated with life in the center, or “house” as it was called, and were written specially for this topic.\n\nIn this hymn, Kaan helps us to pray for love, the “grace to listen,” and to realize the responsibility of the Christian both to live a holy life in “kitchen, office, shop,” and to follow the example of “the servant Christ” in our community relations.\n\nThe hymn has since been slightly revised in order to make it of wider use for work and workers in general, bringing practical Christianity into the daily working life. In stanza 1, line 1, the original “house” has become “world.” Stanza 3 had “wing and floor,” which are altered to “room and yard”; “meeting room” has become the more general “lecture hall”; and the local “cyclostyle and store” have been adjusted to become “office, shop, and ward.”\n\nThe tune WHITWORTH was named by the Canadian composer Walter Louis MacNutt, who was born June 2, 1910, in Charlottetown, Ontario. He attended Toronto College of Music, winning a prestigious scholarship. He studied organ and composition with Healy Willan and piano with Reginald Godden. From 1931 to 1953 he was organist-choirmaster at churches in Barrie, Toronto, Winnipeg, and Windsor. In the latter city he conducted the Windsor Singers for two years in Canadian Broadcasting Company programs. He served St. Thomas’ Church, Toronto, for 23 years, and retired in 1977. Compositions include works for piano, choir, and orchestra, besides a significant body of music written especially for the Anglican Church. One of his most popular publications was the solo song settings of poetic works by William Blake. This unison melody keeps repeating the opening rhythmic pattern, yet it has only a small amount of exact repetition. The development of the theme is logical and easy to master. The composer’s adventuresome harmonic changes make this hymn a delight to play and sing.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "Albert Frederick Bayly (1910-1984; SEE biographies), English congressional minister, was in the forefront of those who began to write hymns in twentieth-century language. Bayly wrote these words in May, 1947, inspired by the Triple Jubilee of the church missionary Society.\n\nIn the original text there were six stanzas, culminating hope of eternal salvation in the last stanza.\n\nThere has been one slight change in SDAH stanza 4, line 3. Originally it read “Until the day this warring world rejoices”; this was changed to” Until the tired, warring world.”\n\nNORTHBROOK was composed by Reginald Sparshott Thatcher, who was on March 11, 1888, at Midsomer Norton, a town near the small Somerset coalfield, near Bath, England. He was an organ scholar at the Royal College of Music and at Worcester College, Oxford, earning the D. Mus, degree. His entire career was a music master, teaching at Clifton College, Royal Naval College, Charterhouse School, and Harrow School.  In 1928 he was president of the Music-Masters association.  Retiring to surrey in 1955, he died there May 6, 1957.\n\nFor about 100 years, 1850 to 1950 the “public schools” in England exerted a sizable influence on the style of the hymn tunes.  The schools were, in fact not public but private boarding schools, run by the church (usually Anglican) for 200 to 1000 children (mostly boys), aged 13 to 18.  The disciple was severe and the rules harshly enforced, much the same as military training.  In contrast with the daily grind, the relaxed atmosphere at compulsory morning and evening prayer in the chapel was a welcome relief.  Under the direction of a creative music master, and with a good organ in a room that acoustically was itself a musical instrument, the singing soared!  Five hundred boys singing in unison a sweeping melody, with an inspiring organ accompaniment—this impetus made many music teachers at “public schools” compose tunes in that style, and some even edited their own hymnals.  NORTHBROOK is from the Clarendon hymn book, 1936, one of the best of these schoolbooks, created for charterhouse school.  Other tunes in SDAH that have come from this tradition are No.247, COME, MY WAY (also known as THE CALL); No.41, GONFALON ROYAL; No. 351, THORNBURY; No. 480, REPTON; and No. 360, CUDDESDON.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "This hymn was written by a man who lived in the city and spent his life caring and working for the people of the city.  It is based on Matthew 22:29; “Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage,” a text on which Frank North had just preached a sermon.\n\nNorth was a corresponding secretary for the New York church Extension and Missionary Society.  His office looked out on busy Fifth Avenue, where he was daily made aware of the stressful and sometimes wretched conditions under which city people live and work.  He had been challenged by Caleb T. Winchester, one of the editors working on the American Methodist Hymnal, 1905, to write a new hymn about the work of city missions.  Evidently the six stanzas did not come to him all at once, for his papers at Drew University are nine portions or unfinished stanzas, together with phrases and ideas he had collected from reading and from speeches he had heard on this subject.  Under the title “A prayer for the Multitudes,” the finish poem was first printed in the June 1903 issue of the Christian City, the journal of the Methodist city Missionary Society, of which North was editor.  Here is the author’s own account of the experience behind this missionary hymn “I…was familiar with the tragedy, as it is always seemed to me, of the jostling, moving currents of the life  of the people as revealed upon the streets and at great crossing the avenues. And I have watched them by the hour as they passed, by tens of thousands.... That [the hymn] has found its way into so many of the modern hymnals and by translation into so many of the other languages is significant, not as to the quality of the hymn itself but as to the fact that it is in an expression of that tremendous movement of the soul of the gospel in our times which demands that the follower of Christ must make the interest of  the people his own, and must find the heart of the world’s need.”\n\nBorn in Manhattan, New York City, on December 3, 1850, Frank Mason North grew up in the teeming city crowds.  After graduating from Wesleyan University, he was ordained a Methodist minister in 1872.  For the next nine years he served churches in Florida; New York City Mission Society and editor of the Christian City.  From 1912 to 1924 he was secretary of the Methodist Board foreign Missions, and for four of these years, president of the Federal council of churches.  Honorary degrees have been conferred upon North by several institutions of learning, and he served on many governing boards.  In 1970, the hymn of the society America published eight of his hymns in a booklet, hymns of Frank Mason North.  He died at Madison, New Jersey, on December 17, 1935.\n\nFor comments on the GARDINER, see SDAH 177, “Jesus, Your Blood and Righteousness.” SDAH uses it again at No. 376, “All Things Are Thine.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "This was the first hymn written by Erik Routley (1917-1983); SEE ON SDAH 13) who is considered to be probably the most dominating force in twentieth-century church music.  In October 1966 Routley was at a music workshop in Dunblane, near Stirling, Scotland.  He was trying to compose a tune, but in the next room another composer was at who was unable to compose without singing out loud.  Frustrated, Routley turned to hymn writing.  He thought of a beautiful tune by Peter Cutts that had no text, and at the time of the American cities that were suffering from riots (specifically, Oakland, California).  The result was this text, which was published in the second volume of Dunblane Praises, 1967.  It is a hymn of caring and concern for the people and the problems of the cities, showing the peace and love that Jesus gives as the answer.  Routley also wrote SDAH 13 “New Songs of Celebration Render,” and the tune SHARPTHORNE, SDAH 571.\n\nThe tune BIRABUS was composed by Peter Cutts (1937-; see Biographies) in the fall of 1962 to be used the following January with the text” In the cross of Christ I Glory” at the student Christian Movement Congress in Bristol, England. The tune name was the pet name given to the vehicle used by the composer and eight others while returning to England from a student conference I Austria in the summer of 1962. This tune is haunting and “different,” yet easy to sing and memorize.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "Jane Borthwick (1813-1897; see SDAH 461) wrote this challenging missionary hymn for church workers; she published it in her thoughts for thoughtful Hours, 1859, with the heading “Always Abounding in the Work of the Lord” (1 Cor. 15:58).  She revised it in 1863.  Reginald McCall, writing in the hymn, October 1953, had this to say about the composer of ORA LABORA (Pray, Work):  “T. Tertius Noble had the double distinction of holding one of England’s highest organ positions—he became organist at York Cathedral when only 31 -and that of carrying on the Anglican tradition in America through his 30 years’ service in St. Thomas’ Church, New York, beginning at the age of 46.”  He was considered the dean emeritus of American organist and choirmasters.  Born May 5, 1867, Bath, England, Thomas Tertius Noble made his first musical appearance at age 11, at 14 he went to Colchester, 50 miles northeast  of London,  to go to school, and was organist  at All Saints’ Church.  He studied under a scholarship to the royal College of Music; his teachers were three knighted musicians; Sir Walter Parratt, organist of St. George’s Chapel, Windsor; Sir Charles Stanford (see SDAH 32), one of the most distinguished musicians of that time. As Stanford’s assistant at Cambridge University, Noble was thrilled to hear the free accompaniments for hymn singing at trinity College Chapel. This experience influence his own style, his best – known works being two collections of free organ accompaniments written to some of the tunes in the Episcopal Hymnal 1940. From 1892 to 1898, Tertius Noble served as organist at Ely Cathedral, one of the largest and most imposing in England, following in the footsteps of Christopher Tye and John Farrant. His next position was at prestigious York Cathedral, where he founded and directed a symphony orchestra.\n\nIn 1913 he accepted the call to one of the finest neo-Gothic churches in America, St. Thomas’ Church in New York City. Here he developed a fine boys’ choir in the best cathedral tradition, and earned a reputation for virtuosity on the new Skinner organ that was built to his specifications. For three years he was president of Hymn Society of America. Honorary degrees were conferred on him by Columbia University and Trinity College, Doctor of Music. He served on the Joint Commission on Church Music for the Episcopal Hymnal 1940. Commemorating 50 years of his service as a church musician is a memorial window in St. Thomas’ Church.\n\nRetiring at age 75 to his home at Rockport, Massachusetts, he enjoyed playing the organ in his home and at the small Episcopal church nearby, which he helped design and build. He wrote many anthems, services, and organ works. He was known for his pursuit of excellence. He continued writing until his death on May 4, 1953.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

This is the theme of the refrain of this hymn “The harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few; pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest” Matt. 9:37–38.\n\nThe words were written in 1885 by J.O Thompson, and the tune HARVEST, so named because of the words, by J.B.O Clemm in 1895.  Nothing is known regarding either of these men. Titled “The Call for Reapers,” the first publication of the song was in the Methodist book The Epworth Hymnal, 1885.  The song first appeared in SDA hymnals in Christ in Song, 1908, and again in Church Hymnal, 1941.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "The setting for this hymn is Matthew 2: 1, 2.  Written in 1873 as a processional hymn for Epiphany (in the church year, the twelfth day after Christmas, commemorating the appearance of the star to the Wise Men and their coming to find and worship Jesus), it was first published in Thring’s Hymn and Sacred Lyrics, 1874.  By the end of the second stanza, these wise men have already begun to share on their homeward journey the “light” they have found.  From there on, the hymn challenges us to a mission of sharing Jesus, “guiding star,” with all the world.\n\nGodfrey Thring was born March 25, 1823, at Alford, a small village near Glastonbury, Somerset, England.  He was educated at oxford, gaining his Bachelor of Arts in 1845.  He was ordained in 1846 and served first in two Berkshire parishes, and then was appointed rector of Alford in 1858.  In 1867 he was promoted to be rural dean, and nine years later prebendary of Wells Cathedral in Somerset.  He was the compiler and editor of a high quality hymnal, A Church of England Hymn Book, 1880, which, it was hoped, would replace other hymnbooks published and sold by different “parties” in the church.  One of these was Hymns Ancient and Modern, which in a revised edition is still being sold today.  After retirement near Guildford, Surrey, Thring died September 13, 1903.  Thring also wrote a portion of SDAH 223, “Crown Him With Many Crowns.”\n\nWilliam Harold Ferguson was born January 1, 1874, at Leeds, England and was educated first as a chorister at Magdalen College, Oxford, then at Keble College, graduating in 1896.  He served as assistant master at St. Edward’s School, Oxford, until 1899, and then at Bilton Grange, near Rugby, for two years.  His training for the ministry was at Cuddesdon College near Oxford, hence the tune name.  After ordination in 1902, He again was assistant master at St. Edward’s School.  He served as 11 years as assistant master, organist, and chaplain at Lancing College: 11 years as warden of St. Edward’s; twelve years as warden of Radley School, Oxford; and 10 years as canon and precentor of Salisbury Cathedral.  He retired in 1947 to Littlehampton in Sussex and died there, October 18, 1950.  He was a member of the headmasters’ Conference, which prepared the public school hymnbook, first printed in 1903 and revised in 1919.  He coedited the music for this work with Geoffrey Shaw.\n\nThe tune CUDDESDON is often used in England with the text “At the Name of Jesus” (see SDAH 232).\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Albert F. Bayly (1901-1984; see Biographies) submitted this hymn text in June 1961, when the Hymn Society of America asked for new hymns on social welfare.  Accepted after some revision, it was used as the conference hymn for the second National Conference on the churches and social Welfare, October 1961.  First included in the 1964 Methodist Hymnal, it also appeared in Lutheran Book of Worship, 1978, with further alterations and set to BEACH SPRING, which unison version SDAH uses.  Melvin West’s harmonization for four –part singing can be found at SDAH 634.\n\nBEACH SPRING (named for Beach Spring Baptist church in Harris County, Georgia) is a tune from a large body of sacred songs that, until about 25 years ago, was largely ignored by hymnal editors—American folk hymns.  Known generically as the Sacred Harp tradition, these hymns were either derived from English Scottish, and Irish folk songs, or were newly composed and sung in that folk song style.  They were published in dozens of “country singing books” such as Kentucky Harmony, Harrisonburg, Virginia, 1816; Tennessee Harmony, Cincinnati, Ohio, 1818; Missouri Harmony, St. Louis, Missouri 1820; Southern Harmony, New Haven, Connecticut, 1835; and The Sacred Harp, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 1844, to name  but a few.  Only one of these books was published New England.  All the rest were from the mountain country of the Southern states, where most of the people from scratched out their living in small farms.  Gathering for hymn singing were a major source of fellowship and entertainment.  The tune books used a system of shaped notes, the shape of the note head indicating the pitch, apart from its location on the lines and spaces of the staff.  The tunes have a charm and simplicity characteristics of most folk music which endears them to our hearts and makes them easy to sing and remember.  The enduring quality of this hymn style is proved by the fact that The Sacred Harp songbook is still selling well after more than 140 years and eight revision—the latest (at this writing) in 1971.  And regular sacred Harp singing conventions are held regularly in many locations in the south, as well as in parts of the Midwest and New England.\n\nThe following is Wayne Hooper’s account of a personal encounter with the Sacred Harp tradition:\n\n“It was my privilege to attend an all-day Sacred Harp ’sing’ in June 1985 at the village of Villa Rica, Georgia, just west of Atlanta.  As we drove up to the Primitive Baptist Church, a simple white rectangle building surrounded by oak trees and grassy lawn, the powerful sound of unaccompanied singing was already pouring forth from open doors and windows.  Inside, we took our seats with the ‘listeners’ and began to soak up this unique experience.\n\n“The unadorned room was all of wood, so the acoustics were great for hymn singing.  Some 60 singers were sitting on the hard pews, arranged in a hollow square.  The leader stood in the middle, beating time with up-and-down hand motions, no matter what the tempo or meter.  Men and women sang the ‘led’ or melody, and were seated in the section facing the leader.  Tenors were to his left, basses to his right, and altos behind him.\n\n“The secretary had the names of all who wished to lead.  As soon as one finished, she would read the name of the next leader.  He or she would go to the center and call out the number to be sung, and which stanzas.  A lead singer on the front row would strike his tuning fork and from that, by relative pitch, sing the ’do,’ ‘mi’ ‘sol’ of the tonic chord.  All the singers would sing the first chord, then they all sang the hymn in four-part harmony, all the way through on the ‘sol’-‘fa’ syllables.  After that, the words of the announced stanzas were sung, in a style that is like no other music anywhere.\n\n“There was no attempt at polish or sophistication.  I guess one of my dad’s little admonitions for singers, ‘Just open your mouth and let the sound roll out!’ most aptly describes what happens.  The narrow range of dynamics runs from f to ff, and that is matched with a rather front-of-the-mouth formation of the vowels, and voices that are powerful and on the brilliant side, the effect is positively awesome!\n\n“There are 547 pages of music in the 1971 edition of The sacred Harp, but it made the difference which song was chosen by the leader—they sang it well and with enthusiasm, I noticed that many of the singers were singing from memory, possibly from long association with this revered book.  (I Primitive Baptist Church for 75 years!)\n\n“During the intermission for lemonade, I spoke with Hugh McGraw, the guiding light of the Sacred Harp movement at Bremen, Georgia.  I told him of my father’s involvement with this style of music and singing.  Thomas Jefferson Hooper grew up in this tradition in Alabama and Oklahoma, and he himself conducted a number of ’10-day singing schools,’ which were popular around the turn of the century, I also told McGraw of my work with the committee for SDAH, including the fact that we were going to have a good number of the hymns in our new book.  When the singing resumed, he took me in, sat me down among the basses, and handed me his own book to sing from.  A few minutes later, to my surprise, the secretary called out my name to be the next leader! McGraw introduced me, telling them I had come all the way from California to sing with them.  After all the directing I have done in my life, my rapid heart rate signaled that I might not be able to get that ‘up-and-down beat’ just right!\n\n“Choosing to lead first THE MORNING TRUMPET (see SDAH 448), I said, ‘I may not have the tempo.’  One of the basses right up with ‘We’ll let you know!’ and they did.  The man with the tuning fork set the pitch, and then helped me get started with his hand motions into their accustomed way of singing that hymn, what a thrill it was to hear this hymn of the Second Coming echo through that old building, in the same style that was set in motion in 1844 by B.F. White, the man who wrote the tune! Next I led HOLY MANNA (see SDAH 1870,  I could see that they were having a good time, watching me enjoy my first experience at leading a group of Sacred Harp singers.\n\n“At 1:00p.m the music began again and continued until 3:30, making a total of nearly five hours of singing! And no one seemed any the worse for wear.  For me it was a most exhilarating day—a golden opportunity to be a part of a hallowed tradition that has been going on in America for more than 150 years!”\n\nTo learn more about this tradition and its music, read White Spirituals in the Southern Uplands, by George Pullen Jackson, Dover Publications, 1965.\n\nThe hymnal Committee recognized the beauty and universal appeal of these American folk hymns, and voted to include a significant number of theme to enrich our singing experience.  The following list gives the hymn number in SDAH; the tune name, if any: and the first line or tile of the hymn, text:\n\n104 RESIGNATION My Shepherd Will Supply My Need\n\n108 NEW BRITAIN Amazing Grace\n\n162 WONDROUS LOVE Wondrous Love\n\n187 HOLY MANNA Jesus, What a friend for sinners\n\n215 MORNING SONG The king shall come\n\n576 MORNING SONG Awake, Awake to Love and Work\n\n236 I LOVE THEE I Love Thee\n\n280 RESTORATION Come, Ye sinners\n\n299 DETROIT Forgive Our sins as We Forgive\n\n334 NETTLETON Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing\n\n363 BEACH SPRING Lord, Whose Love in Humble Service\n\n634 BEACH SPRING Come, All Christians, Be Committed\n\n406 TWENTY-FOURTH Love Consecrates the Humblest act\n\n420 LAND OF REST Jerusalem, My Happy Home\n\n434 CONTRAST We Speak of the Realms\n\n437 I’m Going Home\n\n438 OLD CHURCH YARD You Will See Your Lord A-Coming\n\n446 NEW JERUSALEM Lo, What a Glorious Sight Appears\n\n447 GREENVILLE Long Upon the Mountains\n\n448 MORNING TRUMPET O, When Shall I See Jesus\n\n451 CANAAN Together Let us Sweetly Live\n\n454 WARRENTON Don’t You See My Jesus Coming?\n\n464 PISGAH When I can Read My Title Clear\n\n509 FOUNDATION How Firm a Foundation\n\n620 PROMISED LAND On Jordan’s stormy banks\n\n622 ALL IS WELL Come, Come, Ye saints\n\n631 EMERALD GATES When on Life a Darkness Falls\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Bradford G. Webster wrote this hymn for a contest conducted by the Hymn Society of America in 1954 to choose a hymn for the Urban Life Conference of the Methodist Church held in Columbus, Ohio. Of the more than 200 hymns submitted, this was the winning hymn, published by the society in Five New Hymns on the City, 1954. Since then it has been included in several major hymnals. When he wrote the hymn, the tune in mind was O PERFECT LOVE (see SDAH 656), but the 1972 supplement to the Methodist Book of Hymns, 1964, uses a contemporary tune by American composer Daniel Moe (1926-  ), of Oberlin Conservatory of Music, Ohio. The hymn was sung by the Westminster Choir with Moe’s tune, CITY OF GOD, at the fiftieth anniversary celebration of the Hymn Society at St. Bartholomew’s Episcopal Church, New York.\n\nAs the great cities grow in size and in problems, the people of the church need to catch a new vision of the needs that must be met. In the awareness of the enormity of the church’s mission, there comes to mind Jesus on the Mount of Olives, and His concern for Jerusalem: “And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it.” (Luke 19:41).\n\nBradford Gray Webster was born October 30, 1898, in Syracuse, New York. He was educated at Amherst College, where one of his teachers was the American Poet Robert Frost. His theological training was at Boston University, and later, graduate work at Garrett Theological Seminary, Evanston, Illinois. He began his preaching and pastoral career in 1922 in the Methodist Central New York Conference. He served for 40 years in New York and Pennsylvania churches, retiring to his home in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, in 1964. A lifelong worker in the Boy Scouts, he has been active in service clubs and civic organizations, also. He has a life membership in the Hymn Society of America, and has written many hymns. Webster wrote his text to go with the tune O PERFECT LOVE, while Richard Terry composed his tune HIGHWOOD with the text “O perfect Love, all human thought transcending,” by Dorothy Gurney (see SDAH 656), in mind! His uncle, Lord Runciman, suggested Webster write a tune for the occasion of marriage. The ecumenical Australia Hymn Book, 1982, uses HIGHWOOD with both Gurney’s text and this one. Richard Runciman Terry was born on January 3, 1865, near the seashore at Ellington, Northumberland, England. He grow up in a home where musical friends came often to sing glees, madrigals, etc. At age 11 he was playing the organ in the weekday services of the church. It was here that he developed a lifelong fear of church bells. Ashe said, “In those days when they stopped, I knew the awful moment had arrived for the voluntary, and was invariably seized with stage fright.”\n\nIn 1888 he won a choral scholarship at King’s College, Cambridge, and studied under Sir Charles Stanford (see SDAH 32). After organist-choirmaster positions at St. John’s Cathedral, Antigua, for a year and then back to England at two schools, he became a Roman Catholic and was organist and choirmaster at Downside Abbey, near Bath, Somerset. In 1901 he was appointed director of music at the then unfinished Metropolitan Cathedral at Westminster in 1901, a post he held for 23 years.He excelled as a choral director, and specialized in the performance of early church music. For a time he was a chairman of the Tudor Church Music Publications for the Carnegie Trust, and was the editor of the Westminster Hymnal, 1912, the first official hymnbook for Roman Catholic in England. Durham University honored him with a D. Mus in 1911, and he was knighted in 1922. He died April 18, 1938. Hilda Andrews, in her memoir of Sir Richard Terry, Westminster retrospect, says, “In the presentation of Tudor Music Terry brought his choir to a pitch of excellence that drew musicians from all over the world to hear the forgotten glories of sixteenth-century England translated into living use.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Mary Ann Faulkner was born in London, England, on December 5, 1834, and spent her early years in that country.  She emigrated to the United States and married John Thompson, librarian of the Free Library in Philadelphia.  They were both members of the Protestant Episcopal Church, he being one of the churchwardens.  In 1868 she was sitting up with one of her children who was sick with typhoid fever.  She liked FW. Faber’s hymn, “Hark, Hark, My Soul,” which is in 11.10.11.10 meter, and had a desire to write a missionary hymn in the same meter.  During her night vigil she succeeded in writing the words of stanzas, but a refrain eluded her.  Three years later, in 1871, she wrote words for a refrain, using words from Isaiah 52:7.\nThomson wrote 40 hymns and many poems.  The words of this hymn were published in 1892 in The Church Hymnal of the Episcopal Church; the words and music appeared in the 1894 edition of the same book.  Thomson died on March 11, 1923, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nTIDINGS was composed in 1875 by James Walch (1837-1901; see SDAH 40) for the words “Hark, Hark, my soul,” mentioned previously.  It is so named because of the tidings mentioned three times in the refrain. Seeing that the meter is identical with Thomson‘s hymn, it was fitted to it after having been used for its original purpose in 1877 in The Hymnal Companion to the Book of Common Prayer.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "This hymn was written by Eben Eugene Rexford (1848-1916), whose original first words were “O we are the reapers.”   These words were acceptable to G.F. root and Ira D. L. Moody asked for them to be revised to the present “O where are.”  He wished to avoid the implication that there were no other soul winners than those in the Moody-Sankey evangelistic team.  The omitted stanza is:\n\n2.  Go out in the by ways and search them all,\n\nThe wheat may be there, though the weeds are tall;\n\nThen search in the highway, and pass none by;\n\nBut gather from all for the home on high.\n\nBorn July 16, 1848, at Johnsburgh, New York, Eben moved with his parents to Wisconsin, where he spent the rest of his life. At the age of 16, his literary talent became evident when a magazine sent him a check for a piece he submitted. Entering Lawrence University, Appleton, Wisconsin, he paid his way by writing poems and stories for several Eastern magazines. Composer H. P. Danks saw and liked his “knack” for writing song lyrics, and wrote him, offering three dollars for each song that was good enough to be accepted. Rexford sent him nine, and soon received a check for $18 in payment of six. One of this lyrics was “Silver Threads Among the Gold,” which Danks set to music; it became a worldwide favorite. A number of Rexford poems were also set to music by well-known gospel song composers Root, Excell, and Gabriel; and this one by Ira d. Sankey.\n\nWriting song lyrics was secondary; floriculture articles were Rexford’s first love. For 14 years he was editor of the Gardening Department of Ladies’ Home Journal, and served in a similar capacity for several other magazines. His five books about growing beautiful flowers were best-sellers.\n\nHe was organist at the Congregational church of Shiocton, Wisconsin, for more than 20 years; in 1912, in recognition of his literary work, his alma mater conferred upon the degree of Litt. D. He died in 1916.  He also wrote SDAH 472, “A Song of Heaven and Homeland.”The tune, unnamed, was composed by George Frederick Root (1820-1895; see Biographies). He also composed SDAH 88, VARINA; SDAH 218, JEWELS; and SDAH 692, QUAM DILECTA.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "In the summer of 1869, Frances Jane Crosby (1820- 1915; see Biographies) visited a city mission in one of the worst slum districts of the Bowery and New York City, here she heard about the needs of the perishing souls who were dying without hope and without God in the world. Her sympathies were aroused by the plight of these neglected people. Invited to speak to them, she appealed to any young man who had turned away from his mother’s teaching to have a chat with her after her talk. One of these human derelicts accepted their invitation. Crosby was reminded that a short time previously William Howard Doane (1832-1916; see Biographies) had asked her to write a hymn text on the topic “Rescue the Perishing.” While she was riding home, the lines of this hymn formed in her mind, and before retiring that evening, she had dictated them to a friend. The next morning she sent them to Doane, then in Cincinnati, who composed the tune, sometimes called RESCUE because of the words for which it was written. There is one other stanza:\n\n3. Down in the human heart, crush’d by the temper,\n\nFeelings lie buried that grace can restore;\n\nTouched by a loving heart, wakened by kindness,\n\nChords that were broken will vibrate once more.\n\nThe hymn first appeared in Doane’s Songs of Devotions, 1870.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

Ohio.  It is based on Ecclesiastes 11:4, 6; and Psalm 126:6.  While still an infant, Shaw moved with his parents to Indiana, but when only 12 years old he was bereaved of his father, who bequeathed to him his violin.  He quickly learned to play it and was soon earning more by playing at dances and at concerts than he was by working on the farm.  So he gave up farm work and earned his living as a musician, a singer, and an entertainer.  However, after dedicating his musical talent to the Lord, he began conducting revival meetings from 1859 onward, becoming an itinerant preacher and singing evangelist.  Unfortunately, on returning to Columbus, Mississippi, from an evangelistic crusade in the Dallas, Texas, he lost his life in railway accident near Mckinney; he was the only fatality.\n\nThe tune, an unnamed gospel song, was composed by George A. Minor (1845-1904), who followed the fashion current in his day of repeating the words of the theme of the song several times and using the last line of the stanza to form a refrain.  The song was first published in Precious Hymns, 1870, by Bethany Sabbath school of Philadelphia, with this note: “Printed for our own use and cannot be sold.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "The 1869 convention of the Young Men’s Christian Association was held in Cleveland, Ohio.  The motto over the pulpit, made in evergreen letters, spelled out the words “Christ for the World, and the World for Christ.”  Samuel Wolcott, who attended the convention, was so impressed by the slogan that as he walked home on February 7, 1869, he composed this hymn.  There is one other stanza.\n\nWolcott was born at South Windsor, Connecticut, on July 2, 1813.  He was educated at Yale and then graduated from Andover Theological Seminary in 1837.  In 1840 he went as a missionary to Syria, but ill health compelled him to return in 1842.  He pastored in Congregational churches in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Chicago.  For a time he was secretary of the Ohio home Missionary Society.  Though beginning late in life to write hymns, he did compose more than 200.  He died at Longmeadow, Massachusetts, on February 24, 1886.\n\nITALIAN HYMN was composed in 1769 by Felice de Giardini (1716-1796; see SDAH 71), where it is also used, with alternate harmony, for the words “Come, Thou Almighty King,” for which it was especially written.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

Hakes also compiled Pearly Portals for the Sabbath School, in 1882, and composed 90 of the 146 tunes in that book.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

It was published in a Canadian book in 1886, then in Triumphant Songs by E. O. Excell in 1887. From then until 1966, the success of this song is seen by the fact that it was included in more than 100 books. It was published by F. E. Belden (see Biographies) in his Christ in Song, 1908, which became very dear to the hearts of Seventh-day Adventist.  The original was in the key of B-flat; in SDAH it has been lowered one step to A-flat.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

The original had 18 stanzas. Pollock rewrote it for inclusion in the 1875 edition of Hymn Ancient and Modern, with the title “Litany of the Church.” Webster says, a litany is “a form of liturgical (a rite of public worship) prayer, consisting of a series of invocations and supplications with alternate responses in which clergy and congregation join.” In this litany 18 three-line stanzas, the congregational response “we beseech thee, hear us” is printed up the side of the pages with a large bracket including all the stanzas, showing clearly the author’s intent. SDAH’s fourth stanza is not to be found in Pollock’s book. Thomas Benson Pollock (1836-1896) also wrote SDAH 291, “We Have Not Known Thee” (see for comments on his life).\n\nSONG 13 is one of 16 tunes composed by Orlando Gibbons (1583-1625; see SDAH 263) and rented in the 1623 Hymns and Songs of the Church, by George Wither (1588-1667). It was originally written in two parts, each marked with the number of the song for which Gibbons composed it. Routley notes in The Music Christian Hymns, 1981, that he could not have written this tunes for a congregation, because it would have been illegal to sing Wither’s hymn texts in church. However, a good number of them are still in use today, testifying to their singability. Ralph Vaughan Williams (see Biographies) composed an organ chorale prelude on this melody. As musical editor of English Hymnal, 1906 he also introduced 11 of Gibbons’ tunes to congregational singing, arranging them in four parts.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Annie Louisa Walker was born in 1836 in Brewood, Staffordshire, England. When she was about 17 years of age she emigrated to Canada. At 18 she wrote these words, which are an enlargement and emphasis on the words of Jesus to His disciples, “The night cometh, when no man can work” (John 9:4). It was written in 7.6.7.6.doubled, which is one syllable longer in the fourth and eighth lines of the hymn. For example, the original fourth lines were respectively:\n\nWork, ‘mid the springing flowers\n\nRest cometh sure and soon\n\nWork, for the daylight flies\n\nAlso the night preceded the last line of each stanza. The author utterly disagreed with this reduction from six syllables to five, but the tune DILIGENCE, or this WORK SONG, composed for the words in 1864 by Lowell Mason (1792-1872; see Biographies) popularized the hymn in its present form.\n\nThe words were sent, as were other poems written by Walker, to a Canadian newspaper. Much later, the hymn was published without any acknowledgment of authorship in Sankey’s Sacred Songs and Solos. Walker published Leaves From the Backwoods in 1859, Poems in 1868, and wrote novels, children’s plays, and magazine articles. She married Harry Coghill in 1883, returned to England, and died in Bath, Somerset, on July 7, 1907.\n\nThe original harmony has been modified somewhat by Melvin West (1930-; see Biographies).\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "yearWritten": 1872,
    "historicalContext": "John Greenleaf Whittier wrote these words especially for the dedication of the Plymouth Congregational Church in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1872. To make the hymn suitable for any other church dedication, the original line 4 of stanza 3 has been changed from ‘In the fair garden of the West.” Another change has occurred in the last stanza, where the original line 2 “Fill with Thy love their emptiness.” The hymn contains a similar thought to that expressed in King Solomon’s prayer at the dedication of the Temple, for example: stanza 4, line 2, Behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee” ( 1 Kings 8:27).\n\nJohn Greenleaf Whittier was born on December 17, 1807, near Haverhill, Massachusetts, to poor Quaker farmers of Puritan ancestry. He worked on the farm as a shoemaker and teacher, finally accumulating enough money to attend two sessions at Haverhill Academy. Earlier he had bought a book of poems by Robert Burns from a peddler, which kindled his poetic ability. By age 14 he was writing verse, the first of which was published in the Newburyport Free Press when he was 18.  After a few years of editorial work for two publications, illness forced a return to the farm, where he continued writing at night. These years were made miserable by poverty, disappointment in love, and a general loss of ambition. His first book, Legends of New England in Prose and Verse, was published in 1831. After the farm was sold in 1836, he became editor of the Pennsylvania Freeman. Most of his talent and energy for the rest of his life was spent working for the abolition of slavery. He was elected to the Massachusetts legislature in 1835 ad to the secretaryship of the Anti-Slavery Society in 1836. As a result of his strong stand on the subject, he suffered much abuse from the antiabolitionists, including the burning of his publication office. None of his poems on religious subjects were meant to be hymns. He gave as his reason, “I know nothing of music..... A good hymn is the best use to which poetry can be devoted, but I do not claim that I have succeeded in composing one.” However, hymnal editors have felt otherwise; Julian’s Dictionary of hymnology lists 33 first lines of hymns that have been taken from his poetry and used, especially among American Unitarians. Two of his well-known poems are Snowbound, 1866; and The Eternal Goodness. He died at Hampton Falls, New Hampshire, on September 7, 1892.\n\nHis other hymns in SADH are No. 455, Immortal Love, Forever Full”; and Nos. 480 and 481, “Dear Lord and Father of Mankind.”\n\nGARDINER gets its name from William Gardiner (1770-1853; see SDAH 177), who included it in his Scared Melodies, 1815. This tune is used two more times in SDAH: No. 177, “Jesus, Your Blood and Righteousness”; and No. 355, “Where Cross the Crowded Ways of Life.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

This caused me to write the hymn in question at a time when ordinations were, in the Church of England, confined to men. (The first line was, “Go forth, O Priest, with Christ.”) As a result, I rewrote the hymn for the New English Hymnal, but in the end decided not to include it, since I had found what I thought was a better one for the purpose.”\n\nGeorge Boorne Timms was born October 4, 1910, in Derby, England, and educated at St. Edmund Hall, Oxford, and the Collage of the Resurrection at Mirfield, West Yorkshire. Ordained in Coventry Cathedral, 1925 he served in the following positions: curate in Coventry and Reading; sacrist and succentor of Southwark Cathedral, 1949-1952; vicar of St. Mary’s Primrose Hill, London (this is the church where the English Hymnal, 1906, was born, when Percy Dearmer – see SDAH 259 – was a minister there), 1952-1965; rural dean of Hampstead, 1959-1965; prebendary of St. Paul’s Cathedral, 1964-1971; director of ordination training and examining chaplain to the bishop of London.1965-1971; and for 10 years prior to his retirement in 1981, the archdeacon of Hackney, London. He has been chairman of the English Hymnal Company since 1969. Publications include: The Liturgical Seasons, 1965; editor, English Praise: A Supplement to the English Hymnal, 1975; coauthor, The Cloud of Witnesses, 1982; and editor, The New English Hymnal, 1986.\n\nFor comments on DARWALL’S 148TH and John Darwall, see SDAH 221, “Rejoice, the Lord is King.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

I was taking the nurse’s course at St. Helena Sanitarium, and was not acquainted with John F. Anderson. O was much surprised, sometime later, to discover it as a song in one of our youth songbooks (the Junior Song Book, 1931, later known as Missionary  Volunteer  Songs). It was printed in at least one other.” Actually, John Anderson had copyrighted and printed the song in 1924.\n\nThe poem appeared in the February 28, 1922, issue of the Youth’s Instructor under the title “Keeping the Sabbath.” There were five additional stanzas, but no refrain.\n\nLawrence E.   C.  Joers,     M.D.,     was born August 17, 19000, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He grew up in North Dakota, and attended the Seventh-day Adventist Auburn Academy, Auburn, Washington. His college study was at Walla Walla College; he took the nurse’s training at St. Helena (California) Sanitarium and Hospital in 1924, before taking the medical course at the College of the Medical Evangelists (now Luma Linda University).\n\nAfter internship at Los Angeles County General Hospital in 1934, he practiced in Tacoma, Washington. He served as a captain in the Navy during World War 2 for four years, and in the Korean War for four years. Retiring from the service, he practiced at Ardmore, Oklahoma, for 10 years and at Jay, Oklahoma, for 13 years. In 1973 he went  to Reedsport, Oregon, to help build up and pastor the local Seventh-day Adventist church.\n\nJohn F. Anderson was born April 8, 1893, in Paragould, Arkansas, into a farming Methodist family of 16 children. He married Ruth Reinhard Fillman, an SDA schoolteacher. Together they conducted short “singing schools” in Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. He accepted the SDA faith in 1923, and was baptized at the Enid, Oklahoma, camp meeting by D.   F.  Sturgeon. Engaging in literature evangelism in 1923, he was promoted to field secretary ( now called publishing secretary) on the Oklahoma Conference.\n\nIn 1926 he began singing evangelism, assisting a number of preachers in the Southwestern states. He began writing songs soon after baptism, and used them in his own work. Becoming an evangelist himself, he held meetings in several states and raised up his first church in Tulia, Texas, with 40 members. Later he was pastor of nine churches in Texas; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; and Takoma Park, Maryland. Retiring in 1941, he continued his pastoral work in the Southwest, often moving to a small church that needed help. For a time he lived in California, with burden to help the families of his brothers and sisters spiritually. After this he spent some time in the Lord’s service at Ketchum and Ardmore, Oklahoma; the Rio Grande Valley of Texas; and Keene, Texas. At the time of his death at Loma Linda, California, on December 16, 1974, he was working on a new song. A booklet of 13 of his songs, including “City of Gold,” was published, titled Songs of Faith and Hope, 1934.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "This hymn is one of several written by Christopher Wordsworth to inculcate the doctrines of the church and was in his Holy Year, or Hymns for Sundays and Holydays, 1862. It is based on Psalm 118:24: “This  is the day which the Lord has made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.” It exalts the Sabbath (although the author is referring to Sunday), and several metaphors are used, namely balm, port, garden, fountain, mountain and, in an omitted stanza, a ladder. There were originally six stanzas from which the SDAH has selected the first, third, the second half of the fourth, and the first half of the sixth. In SDAH stanza 3, the fifth word originally was refection, meaning eating, referring to feeding on the Word of God, though it is quite true that we should also reflect on it Wordsworth, a nephew of the famous poet William Wordsworth, was born in Lambeth, London, on October 30 1807. He was educated at the University of Cambridge, where he had a brilliant career, winning many prizes and graduating in 1830. He lectured at his college in classics and was ordained in the Anglican ministry in 1833. In 1836 he became public orator at the university and was appointed headmaster of Harrow Public School. In 1844 canon of Westminster Abbey. From 1850 to 1869 he was vicar of the small village of Stanford-in-the-Vale-cum-Goosy; Goosy was an even smaller village south of Stanford, Oxford shire. From this humble position he was called in 1869 to be bishop of Lincoln, a position that he held until a few weeks before his death at Harewood, near Leeds, Yorkshire, on March 21 1885. Wordsworth was a voluminous writer, for a part from his 127 original hymns, he wrote a commentary in the Bible, several volumes of history, some on the classics, sermons, pamphlets, and speeches.\n\nELLACOMBE is found in X. L. Hartig’s Mainzer Gesangbunch, 1833, but this is derived from a traditional tune of the eighteenth century. It appears in a hymnbook used in the private chapel of the duke of Wurttemberg, 1784. It first appeared in England in Hymns Ancient and Modern, 1868, with the words “Come, Sing with Holy Gladness.” It is a very easy melody to sing, for scores 1, 2, and 4 are identical.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

It had five stanzas and was entitled “Saturday Evening,” which to Newton was the time immediately preceding the day of rest, in harmony with the Levitical custom: from even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath” (Lev. 23:32). This is made clear in the original fourth line of stanza 1, which was “On the approaching Sabbath day.” Then line 6 of stanza 2 was “May we rest this night in Thee,” i.e., Saturday night! Hence the beginning of stanza 3: “When the morn,” i.e., Sunday Morning.\n\nSABBATH was composed in 1824 and so named for the words by Lowell Mason (1972-1872; see Biographies).\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

(Bud) Roberts [college Place, Washington, Village SDA Church] was going to be preaching on that topic in May of 1982, I quickly formulated my ideas so that he could use the hymn to conclude his sermon. Realizing that so many of the pioneers wrote their own hymns for the occasion, I was happy to help him, the congregation responded very favorably. (We used a single verse as a vesper benediction for a time at Kingsway College.)  …  I am a joyful person who wants to share beauty with enthusiasm. This is the approach I have taken to the Sabbath hymn. There is  not a shred of legalism connected to this view of Sabbath. It was never created as a test, though we know it will be the final issue in the battle between the forces of good and evil. However, I feel if it is viewed in the light of being the most precious gift the lord has bestowed on us for all time and eternity, then it will draw people to realize how gracious and loving the Lord is, and not a tyrant who is just waiting for people to step over the line!”\n\nRegarding the third stanza, she wrote: “I feel the idea of having to learn how to observe the sabbath is a unique one I have not found duplicated in another hymn. (Adam and Eve were taught of God. We need the Lord’s guidance in this regard today. We will need to learn this in heaven.) The word ever means the sabbath peace and blessings will form a very cocoon around our entire existence, not only now, but in the life to come. In this life of change, it is the one constant we can relate to for time and eternity!”\n\nShe submitted her hymn in the New Hymn Poem Search conducted by the SDAH Committee. At their suggestion, she revised the second stanza, which then became the final one.\n\nBorn March 5, 1934, to Anna F. and John M. O’Brien, in Winnepeg. Manitoba, Canada, Worthie Gem Lenore O’Brien was the youngest of seven daughters. Naturally gifted in music, she was already playing piano for church and evangelistic meetings in her pre-teen years. At 15 she was the pianist for the Canadian Youth Congress of 1949. She took training as a concert pianist in Vancouver, British Columbia, and holds the ARCT degree in piano performance and teaching from Royal Conservatory of Music, University of Toronto. Her career includes teaching posts at Walla Walla, Washington; church organist in Vancouver, British Columbia, at Canadian Union College, and College Place, Washington. She says that one of her most rewarding periods was the seven years she was minister of music for the First C0ngregational Church, Walla Walla, Washington.\n\nFitch’s husband is the director of education, Canadian Union Conference of Seventh-day Adventists.\n\nTo Wayne Hooper (1920-: see Biographies), the executive secretary of the SDAH Committee, fell the responsibility, which he shared with his wife, Harriet, of being the “clearinghouse” for all submitted materials. When Gem Fitch’s Sabbath hymn came in the mail, Wayne was immediately struck by the first line, comparing the beauty of the Sabbath to the finest of the jewels that might adorn a monarch’s crown. So he set the poem to music and submitted it at the next meeting of the committee. They made a few suggestions for its improvement, he took it home for a complete rewrite, and at the next meeting the tune was approved as here printed.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Ottilie Stafford professor of English at Atlantic Union College, South Lancaster, Massachusettes, was a member of the SDAH Committee. Born February 12, 1921, in Middletown, New York, the only child in a family of denominational workers, she has been surrounded all her life with the sounds, discussions, and friendships of the church family. Very early in life she started loving and studying music. She earned a B.A. at Atlantic Union College and an M.A. and Ph.D. at Boston University. For a period of time just after leaving college, she was a music teacher. A part of her work in music was under the tutelage of Astrid King, whose interest in church music opened Stafford’s eyes to the concerns of hymnology. Although her graduate work and professional career have been in English, she has retained her interest in church music- as she says, “Where better to combine an interest in poetry and an interest in music than in the great music of the church?” Stafford gives us these words about how this text was written:\n\n“One day during the committee’s meetings, Melvin West [chairman of the tunes subcommittee] asked me to listen to a hymn tune that he had composed for another purpose, but would like to have words written for. I liked the stately and quite music, and an idea that had been half formed in the back of my head began to take shape. He wanted a Sabbath hymn that began with the first Sabbath, reflected on our present experience, and looked forward to the renewed worship, with the Creator of the Sabbath, in a restored world. So I went home and worked on it, and out of this came the hymn as it now appears in the hymnal. One thing that struck me as I worked was the difficult nature of the writing words for hymn tunes, in which the inflections of the words needed to fit the inflections of the music. I finished with a new respect for the great hymn writers!”\n\nSDAH 615, “Rise Up, o church of God!” is a hymn that Stafford revised for this hymnal, and SDAH 471, “Grant Us Your Peace,” is her translation.\n\nWALLOWA was composed by Melvin West (1930-; see Biographies) in the 1960s while he was chairman of the Music Department at Walla Walla College, College Place, Washington. He wrote it as a setting for a new college hymn, but as it turned out, the school decided to keep its old traditional song. The tune lay dormant until in the hymnal committee meeting he asked Ottilie Stafford (they had known each other and worked together years earlier at Atlantic Union College) if she would like to create a hymn text on the subject of the Sabbath to go with his tune. The tune name comes from the Wallowas, mountain in the northeast corner of Oregon where, West says, his family “spent undoubtedly the happiest Sabbaths of our lives!”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

It was published in his Andachtige Herze (Devout Hearts), 1714, in seven stanzas. Translated by Catherine Winkworth (1827-1878; see Biographies) but with the last stanza omitted, it appeared in her Lyra Germanica, Second series, 1858, titled “For the Sabbath Morning,” and later in her Chorale Book for England, 1863. Several other authors made translations but this is considered to be the best. The first appearance in America was in Hymns of the Ages, Second Series, Ticknor and Fields, Boston, 1861. Winkworth adds Schmolck’s name, but gives the date as 1731.\n\nThe HINCHMAN was composed by a very successful dry-goods merchant who was born June 17, 1834, in Brooklyn, New York. As a young man, Uzziah Christopher Burnap studied music in Paris and later served for 37 years as organist at the Reformed Church in Brooklyn Heights. A composer of many hymn tunes, he also collaborated with John Knowles Paine of Harvard University in compiling Hymns and Songs of Praise, and edited a hymnal for the Reformed Church, Hymns of the Church: with tunes, New York, 1869. He died December 8, 1900.\n\nNotice that the rhythm of two quarter notes followed by two half notes is repeated in each line, and the melody in the first phrase of the second score is repeated at the interval of a third higher, Burnap also arranged SDAH 455 SERENITY.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "In the middle and late 1940s the British Union Conference of Seventh-day Adventists had a committee working on a replacement for the Advent Hymnal (Revised), which had been in use in that and other fields since 1928. The secretary of the committee, Joseph Harker (see SDAH 265), asked Myrtle Hope Dorland, who was then the teacher of English and literature at the Stanborough secondary School, to write two hymns for the new hymnal, one on the Second Advent and another on the Sabbath. The New Advent Hymnal was ultimately published in 1952, being delayed because of the bomb damage during World War II to music printing houses.  Both of Dorland’s hymn were included in the hymnal. This one was written in February 1945 to the meter of the tunes DENNIS (SDAH 350). It was revised in stages, and the present draft was completed in May 1945.\n\nThe author felt the Sabbath hymn for Seventh-day Adventist would be different from a Sunday hymn for those observing that day as the Lord’s Day. Also she considered the widely different education and intelligence of the singers, as well as the diversity of musical and literary appreciation. The final result was a hymn that would suit all tastes, drawing heavily on Scripture. This last feature came readily, for in her childhood Myrtle had committed hundreds of Bible verses to memory and was encouraged to look up all the verses heard during the preaching of the sabbath sermon. In a triennial Bible contest arranged by Israel she was among the eight finalists.\n\nDorland was called to Newbold College to lead the Department of English and Education, which she did from 1947 to 1953. She married Jens Arne Hansen, a SDA minister from Denmark. Apart from their service in that country, they were missionaries in the Faeroe Islands from 1954 to 1957 and in Greenland from 1963 to 1970.\n\nTRENTHAM was composed by Robert Jackson, born in 1842 at Oldham, England. He studied at the Royal Academy of Music in London and was organist for a time at St. Mark’s Church, Grosvenor Square. Then he returned to Oldham to become organist at St. Peter’s Church, succeeding his father, who had occupied that position for 48 years. The son remained in that same position for 46 years and was also director of the Oldham Music Society. Jackson composed several other hymn tunes, for example NIAGARA, which appears in some modern hymnals. He died July 12, 1914, at Royton, near Oldham.\n\nThis tune is named TRENTHAM after a town in Staffordshire. It was written in 1888 especially for Henry w. Baker’s “O Perfect Life of Love.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

It is based on the theme of the “Andante” with variations. Pleyel was born June 1, 1757, in Ruppersthal, near Vienna, Austria, the twenty-fourth child of the village school master. He studied under Haydn in Vienna for five years, and later in Italy. He was appointed assistant director of music at Strasbourg Cathedral, and then director in 1789. This, however, was cut short by the French Revolution. He went to London in 1791 to conduct special concerts, and then moved to Paris in 1807, where he established a piano factory and a music publishing business. These enterprises were so successful that he devoted all his time to their operations and gave up musical composition. He died in Paris on November 4, 1831.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

She became a Seventh-day Adventist after reading books left on her doorstep by a literature evangelist. For eight years she worked in the Coast Guard Headquarters and the Federal Communications Commission, then moved to denominational work, serving in the Potomac Conference office and at General Conference headquarters. In midlife she began free-lance writing, her stories, poems, and articles being published in Listen, These Times, Adventist Review, Guide, and Little Friend. After retirement she traveled and studied in Mexico and Scotland. Her greatest joy was in “seeing God’s work progress and in doing Christian witnessing and church work.” Returning, she made her home at Summersville, West Virginia, where she died October 4, 1985.\n\nSTRACATHRO is from the composer’s book Christian Vespers, published in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1832. It is considered one of the finest of the later psalm tunes. Charles Hutcheson was born in 1792 and lived all his life as a merchant in Glasgow. A member of St. George’s Church there, he had a good singing voice, loved psalmody and music in general, and had a natural gift as an amateur composer. His book mentioned above contained hymn tunes in three and four parts, with an introductory essay on church music.

    "historicalContext": "The anonymous author of this hymn has expanded the simple literal meaning of the Sabbath as a day of rest from physical labor and referred to its deeper spiritual meaning-a day of rest for the soul, a time when the cares of this life are lost in the calm that accompanies peace of mind. The double blessing mentioned in the last stanza refers to that first pronounced upon the Sabbath after it was given in Eden-“God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it” (Gen. 2:3)-joined to the concept of the presence of Jesus with us as we worship Him. First printed in an Evangelical Lutheran hymnal in 1860, the hymn has been used in America only in SDA hymnals, in 1876, 1881, 1886, and 1941.\n\nPARK STREET is named after an old Puritan meetinghouse Street, Boston, known as a stronghold of orthodoxy. The arrangement made in 1820 by the Handel and Haydn Society of Boston, from an original melody composed in 1810 by Frederick Marco Antonio Venua (1788-1872). Born in Paris of Italian parents, he attended the Paris Conservatory for a time, but in 1805 went to London for the study of violin and composition. He became a member of the Royal Society of Musicians, and musical director of the ballet for the King’s Theater. William Gardiner, who brought the tune into use in his Sacred Melodies, 1812, said he got it from an adagio dance written by Venua for the ballet. Venua eventually stayed and worked in London for nearly 60 years. PARK STREET is also used for SDAH 17, “Lord of All Being, Throned Afar.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "Both words and music of this hymn were composed by Douglas Albert Raoul Aufranc (1892-1980), a Seventh-day Adventist physician and dentist. After a period of intense work and strain in the rush and bustle of the great city of London, he spent a short holiday at Pevensey Bay, between Hastings and Eastbourne on the Sussex coast in England. The peace of this quiet place, especially on the Sabbath day, contrasted vividly with the noise of the city, and the idea of the hymn had its roots there, although words and music were written after he returned to London. Notice the recurrence of the Sabbath theme in the third line of stanzas 2, 3, and 4.\n\nAufranc, of Swiss Huguenot descent, was a grandson of one of the first converts of John Nevins Andrews in Switzerland.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "This is one of two Sabbath hymns SDAH has taken from the Union Hymnal, published by the Central Conference of American Rabbis, New York, in 1932 and revised in 1948. (The other hymn is SDAH 387, “Come, O Sabbath Day.”) When preparing this Jewish hymnal, one of the main purposes kept in view was to make it, according to the preface, as “Jewish as possible, and thus meet one of the needs of our modern synagogal life, namely the adaptation of Jewish traditional music to the usage and taste of our own days.” Jewish composers were called upon to submit original hymn tunes that would preserve the style of synagogal melody.\n\nDavid Levy, born in 1854, wrote the texts for three hymns found in Union Hymnal. The Acknowledgments section refers to “the late David Levy, whose poems are a memorial to his service on the Committee on Revision.” So he must have been a valued member, and one could assume that he died a short time before 1948. Efforts to find out more about him have failed. Especially touching in this text is the third stanza, which asks God’s blessing on all who are in pain, or distressed, and those who mourn the loss of a loved one.\n\nThe unnamed tune is by Max Grauman, who for a time was a cantor of the West End Synagogue, New York. He composed a Friday evening service, “Song of Prayer,” in the style of Sulzer, with a few genuine Jewish cantor solos with organ accompaniment. His popularity was a result of the charm of his melodies and the effectiveness of the parts he wrote for the cantor. He also composed “Musical Service for New Year and Day of Atonement.” A letter from Rabbi Elliot L. Stevens of the Central Conference of American Rabbis states, “He did some work for Rabbi James Heller, back in the 1930s, at the Isaac M. Wise Temple, Cincinnati, Ohio.” It seems entirely appropriate that we borrow these hymns from this Reformed branch of the Jewish religion, who share with Seventh-day Adventists a special feeling of love and reverence for the holy hours of the Sabbath.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "This hymn was published in Faith Looking Forward, 1983, with the heading “And Can It Be?” which refers to the opening line of Charles Wesley’s hymn at SDAH 198. Brian Wren (1936-; see Biographies) says he wrote this as a “restatement in contemporary terms, but not a replacement, of Wesley’s hymn.” The hymn sees God’s gracious love in the context of sin built into socioeconomic structures, but also of Christian hope.\n\nEach of the five stanzas brings some fresh, new thought to make the Communion service vivid. At the end of the third stanza notice the surprise of “We strain to glimpse Your mercy seat, And find You kneeling at our feet.” Wren calls this one of his favorites among the more than 40 hymns he has written, and says, “It’s not an easy hymn to sing, but I wanted to express what Christ can do for emptiness and desolation, which is really suffering in silence. There was a lot of me in writing that hymn. Not that this was my personal experience, really. It became clear to me that it was the personal experience of quite a few people.” Try singing the stanzas, one or two at a time, in appropriate parts of the service.\n\nThe tune RYBURN was first written by Norman Cocker for the British Broadcasting Company Hymn book. He was born in 1889 at Sowerby Bridge, Yorkshire, England. At the age of 20 he became organist and choirmaster of St. Philip and St. James, Oxford. From 1912 to 1915 he served as music master for Magdalen College, Oxford, where he was conductor of the Light Music Orchestra. From 1914 to 1918 he was a soldier in World War I, and then began, in 1919, a long association with the music of Manchester Cathedral, as suborganist until 1943, and then as organist for 10 years; he died November 15, 1953. He was recognized as a first-class trainer of choirs and was very creative as a keyboard improvisor. He left very few compositions and hymn tunes, the best known being TUBA TUNE for the organ. RYBURN is in the form of ABABCD.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "historicalContext": "Fred Pratt Green (1903-; see Biographies) wrote this hymn in 1973 in answer to John Wilson’s request for a text to utilize this beautiful folk tune. Its name, O WALY WALY, comes from the opening words of the song traditionally accompanying the melody. The words appear in Allan Ramsay’s Tea Table Miscellany, 1724-1732, and begins “O Waly, Waly, gin Love be Bonny.” They tell of a woeful maiden whose lover has forsaken her, leaving her pregnant and alone in the world. In recent years it has been heard with a secular text in America, performed by a popular singing group but with a slightly different melody.\n\nThe authentic melody, as collected by the renowned English folk song researcher Cecil Sharp (1859-1924), was arranged by John Wilson for unison voices. In this form it was first published in Hymns for Celebration, the Royal School of Church Music’s supplement of hymns for the Communion service. In 1974, it was sung at a service of thanksgiving for the life and work of John’s wife, Mary. It is very effective when sung as a solo.\n\nBorn January 21, 1905, at Bournville, near Birmingham, England, John Whitridge Wilson graduated in science (M.A.) and music (B.Mus.) at Cambridge University, then went on to a further study of music at the Royal College of Music in London. After holding junior teaching posts, he became director of music at Charterhouse, the famous English public school (1945-1955), and then joined the teaching staff of the Royal College of Music (1965-1980). He was considered to be England’s leading hymnologist by Erik Routley (see SDAH 13), a compliment indeed, coming from one whom most experts count among the world’s greatest hymnologists. Wilson would rather be considered a strong promoter of congregational hymn singing and the writing and use of new hymns. In this he follows in the footsteps of his uncle, Sir Walford Davies (see SDAH 641). Wilson’s editorial work in hymnody began with the Clarendon Hymn Book, 1936, and was resumed for Hymns for Church and School, 1964; Hymns and Songs, 1969; Broadcast Praise, 1981; and most recently, the large Methodist and ecumenical Hymns and Psalms, 1983. He has been one of the speakers and promoters of a most successful series of hymn festivals in Westminster Abbey called “Come and Sing.” Although he retired in 1965, he continues to lecture on acoustics and harmony at the Royal College of Music in London. Currently he is treasurer of the Hymn Society of Great Britain and Ireland. He is the composer of SDAH 584, LAUDS.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

He studied organ in Plymouth, and later emigrated to the United States, where he studied composition in Minneapolis and in Chicago. He was a teacher of art and music in various Seventh-day Adventist colleges, including Union College, Lincoln, Nebraska, for 40 years.

    "historicalContext": "James Arnold Blaisdell, born December 15, 1867, at Beloit, Wisconsin, received his education at Beloit College and Hartford Theological Seminary in Hartford, Connecticut. Ordained a Congregational minister in 1892, he was a pastor in Waukesha, Wisconsin, and Olivet, Michigan, before becoming professor of biblical literature at Pomona College, Claremont, California, for 18 years, 1910-1928. His outstanding work resulted in the conferring of honorary degrees by Hartford Theological Seminary, Occidental College in Los Angeles, California, and the\nUniversity of California. He died at Claremont, California, January 29, 1957.\n\nThis hymn text first appeared in American Student Hymnal, 1928, then later in the Methodist Hymnal, 1964.\n\nThis hymn is based on the idea that the Lord’s Supper is truly celebrated each time we have a fellowship in the breaking of bread in our homes with those who need our love. The second stanza says, “The bread is always consecrate Which men divide with men.” (See SDAH 259 for Percy Dearmer’s concept along a similar line.)\n\nPERRY was composed in 1962 especially for this text, and included in The Book of Hymns, 1964. Leo Sowerby wrote it at Put-in-Bay, Ohio, the site of the International Peace Monument. It was from this bay that Commodore Oliver H. Perry went forth to his naval victory on Lake Erie during the War\nof 1812.\n\nLeo Sowerby, born May 1, 1895, at Grand Rapids, Michigan, studied at the American Conservatory, Chicago, and received the M. Mus. degree in 1918. In World War I he was bandmaster in Europe for the 332nd Field Artillery. In 1921 he was the first to receive the Rome Prize (three years of study in Italy) from the American Academy in Rome. Back in America, he was appointed head of theory and composition at American Conservatory in 1923. Amazingly, he held that position for 40 years! From 1927 to 1963 he was organist-choirmaster at St. James’s Episcopal Church, Chicago. Eastman School of Music, Rochester, New York, awarded him the D. Mus. degree in 1934. For six years before his death on July 7, 1968, he served as director of the College of Church Musicians, Washington Cathedral, in the nation’s capital. He was a member of the tunes committee for the Episcopal Hymnal 1940, for which he furnished two original tunes and three arrangements. The Hymnal 1940 Companion says, “A fluent yet craftsmanlike composer, his works are fully developed in his mind before being put to paper, and seldom changed thereafter.” His first work, a violin concerto, was composed and performed when he was just 18. His symphonies and concertos were often given their premiere performances by the Boston and Chicago symphony orchestras. Organ works, anthems, and church music from his prolific pen have achieved wide circulation and performance.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "It was in July 1968, while serving as pastor of the Congregational Church, Hockley, Essex, England, that Brian Wren (1936-; see Biographies) wrote this text. As were many of his hymns, it was written to fill a special need, this one as the conclusion of a series of sermons on the Communion service. “Its purpose,” he said, “was twofold: to start with an individualistic ‘I come with joy’ and end with a sense of being bound together with everybody else. This was a deliberate progression because I wanted to move away from what I think is an overemphasis on the individual in Communion hymns. The other purpose was to make suggestions about eucharistic [Communion] theology in a very simple way. It has lines like ‘His presence is always near,’ ‘is in such friendship better known.’ I understand the real presence of Christ in the eucharist to be in the gathering of people who are committed to each other” (The Hymn, January 1981).\n\nThe original had a more sexist wording in stanzas 2 and 3, “man’s true community of love” and “as Christ breaks bread for men to share.” In 1977 the editors of an American hymnal advised him to make the revised version here printed, which he admitted was “in every way an improvement.”\n\nDOVE OF PEACE gets its name from the text associated with this anonymous early American melody. In six stanzas it tells of the search everywhere for the Dove of peace; at the end of the search He is found “by meek religion’s humble cot.” This version was printed in an early edition of the Original Sacred Harp, published by B. F. White in 1844. The facsimile found below has three staves of music containing tenor on the top, melody in the middle, and bass on the bottom.\n\nThe present arrangement is by Charles F. Frischmann. Born January 17, 1938, at Latrobe, Pennsylvania, he graduated summa cum laude in organ and church music from Westminster Choir College, Princeton, New Jersey. He earned the M.Mus. in choral conducting at the same school in 1964. His varied career has included: teaching theory at his alma mater for 15 years; director of music for Lutheran and Episcopal churches in New Jersey and Pennsylvania; music editor and arranger for J. S. Paluch Company, World Library Publications, the Polish National Catholic Church, Columbia Pictures Publications, and the Lutheran Church in America; and supervisor of the school music program in Princeton, New Jersey. His publications number more than 100 choral pieces, organ arrangements, and original compositions, distributed by five major music publishers. He has been much in demand as a festival leader and workshop speaker in the areas of organ playing, hymnology, and church music. Enjoying a hobby of American history and antiques, he has restored a pre-Revolutionary farmstead in Pennsylvania.\n\nCare needs to be exercised in selecting a tempo for this 6/8 rhythm that the dignity of this joyful text without suggesting triviality. Consider this as a possible way to use this hymn in the Communion service: stanza 1 at the very beginning; stanzas 2, 3, and 4 during the passing of the emblems; and stanza 5 as a response to the benediction at the close.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

She went to the first musical institute held in Chicago by C. M. Cady, in 1856. For a time she taught music in the Ladies’ Seminary at Lyons, Iowa. Horatio R. Palmer encouraged her in creative writing, and she furnished a number of songs for his collections. She also published The Royal Anthem Book, 1882, which was the first anthem collection by a woman. Tragically, while visiting Dubuque, Iowa, she was killed June 21, 1897, when thrown from a buggy pulled by a runaway horse. The first publication of this hymn was in Best Hymns No.2, compiled by E.

    "historicalContext": "This hymn was written by George Rawson in 1857 and was first published in the Baptist Psalms and Hymns, 1858, titled “The Lord’s Supper.” Originally it consisted of six stanzas.\n\nGeorge Rawson was born in Leeds, Yorkshire, on June 5, 1807, and educated in Manchester, Lancashire. He trained to be a solicitor and practiced this profession in his native town for many years. He was an energetic member of the Congregational Church and assisted their ministers in Leeds to prepare Psalms, Hymns, and Passages of Scripture for Christian Worship, 1853, a book now known as the Leeds Hymnbook. In 1858 he helped Baptist ministers prepare a hymnbook for their own denomination. He contributed also to the Leeds Sunday School Hymn Book, 1858. Then he made a collection of his own hymns in Hymns, Verses, and Chants, 1876. Some more hymns were added to these in his Songs of Spiritual Thought, 1885. Changes were made in these last two volumes, not necessarily improvements in some cases; for example, line 2 of stanza 2 was “Is shown” instead of the current “Is here,” which could be capable of misinterpretation. Also, line 3 of stanza 4 was “By one blest chain of loving rite.” Rawson retired to Clifton, Bristol, where he died on March 24, 1889.\n\nJ. Bruce Ashton was born March 29, 1941, at Columbus, Ohio, and had early music lessons from his aunt, Grace Nicola. His mother’s musical family had often provided worship service music for the Worthington, Ohio, SDA church, either as a string or saxophone ensemble. He graduated from Mount Vernon Academy, Ohio, in 1958 and continued his education at Capital University, Columbus, Ohio (B.Mus., 1963); American Conservatory of Music, Chicago (M. Mus., 1964); and College Conservatory of Music, University of Cincinnati (D.M.A., 1971); all of these degrees being earned in piano performance. From 1964 to 1968 he taught at Walla Walla College, College Place, Washington, and since 1968 has been professor of music at Southern College, Collegedale, Tennessee. Ashton also plays the viola, his wife plays the cello, and their three children are string players. They were all a part of the large orchestra that accompanied the singing of two of Ashton’s choral-orchestral arrangements at the 1985 General Conference session in New Orleans. (One of these arrangements is slated for publication.) Bruce is a local elder, Sabbath school leader, and teacher; he and his wife have made significant contributions to the publications provided by the General Conference Sabbath School Department for juniors and early teens. He is much appreciated for his skill and performance as a piano recitalist and as a sensitive accompanist.\n\nAbout ANTICIPATION, Ashton writes: “By Christ Redeemed’ was a favorite of a former pastor and close personal friend, Amos Cooper. In his native England it was frequently used. In my opinion, the tune in Church Hymnal, 1941, was not well matched, so when I became aware that the SDAH Committee wanted a new setting, my attachment to Amos prompted me to try providing a more fitting version. Actually, I wrote three: a minor-key unison tune that I did not submit but have since made into an anthem; a strong, upward-looking tune in A major; and a more contemplative one in E-flat, which the committee selected.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "In the days of slavery in the United States, Blacks were often forbidden to have their own gatherings, but many did so anyway in secret. Miles Mark Fisher, in his Negro Slave Songs in the United States, 1953, says that this is one of the songs they used as a signal to convene a secret meeting. The first two stanzas were added after the Civil War, making it a Communion hymn.\n\nThe Bible uses the sun as a symbol of God: “For the Lord God is a sun and shield” (Ps. 84:11); “But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings” (Mal. 4:2). Ellen G. White that Jesus used the sun as a symbol of Himself: “It was morning; the sun had just risen above the Mount of Olives, and its rays fell with dazzling brightness on the marble palaces, and lighted up the gold of the Temple walls, when Jesus, pointing to it, said, ‘I am the light of the world’ ” (The Desire of Ages, pp. 463, 464). She also used the sun as a symbol in her comments on the Lord’s Supper: “As the Lord’s disciples gather about His table, they are not to remember and lament their shortcomings. in the shadow of the cross, but in its saving light. They are to open the soul They are not to stand to the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness” (Ibid., p. 659).\n\nOrdinarily, we do not partake of the bread and wine, emblems of Christ’s body and blood, on our knees in the service. Seldom do we sing praise songs on our knees, nor gather for the Communion service early in the morning. All of these expressions are poetic imagery and need to be understood and appreciated in the same way as with the graphic imagery in all hymns and poetry.\n\nThe arrangement of the music was made by Leland Sateren (1913-; see SDAH 407) and first appeared in Contemporary Worship 4: Hymns for Baptism and Holy Communion, 1972. In 1978 it was included in Lutheran Book of Worship.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "historicalContext": "This is the first hymn written by Frederik Kaan (1929-; see Plymouth Biographies), and was one of many he wrote during his ministry at Plymouth to fill the gaps in the hymnbook, particularly in the areas of baptism, marriage, and Communion. It was written in 1964 and appeared in Pilgrim Praise, 1967, one of fifteen hymns listed especially for the Communion service.\n\nKaan’s paraphrase of 1 Corinthians 12:25, “the sacrament of care,” adopted as the theme of the 145th International Assembly of the World Federation of Diaconal Associations, held at Warwick University, July 1983; this hymn was used as the theme song. The particular emphasis on this as a post-Communion hymn is that it shows that the Lord’s breaking the bread and sharing it with His disciples was symbolic of His desire for them in turn to share Him, the Bread of Life, to the world. The Communion service, then, is not only a time of worship but also a preparation for service.\n\nDEUS TUORUM MILITUM (God of Thy Soldiers) is a French melody found in the Grenoble Antiphoner, 1753, as a hymn for martyrs. For half a century from about 1670, French melodies of this type began to displace the former plainsong chants. They were collected by François de la Feillee in his Méthode du Plain-Chant et de la Psalmodie, 1750, which ultimately went into eight editions. Most of these French melodies were either in triple time and Long Meter, or in Sapphic Meter, that is, 11.11.11.5. The arrangement is by Melvin West (1930- ).\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "G.B. McManus, the writer of this hymn about foot washing, was a devout Methodist. Its first publication was by Mennonites, and its presence in SDAH can be credited to Lutherans, who included it in their Lutheran Book of Worship, 1978. However, Seventh-day Adventists are the very few who are not content merely to sing about Christ washing the disciples’ feet; they regularly follow His counsel in John13:14-17. The ordinance of humility is a very meaningful Communion service-a time for putting aside differences, a time to tell a person of our love and appreciation, and a time to show our willingness to be a servant.\n\nThis text was first published by the Mennonite church, Elkhart, Indiana, in Church and Sunday School Hymnal, 1902. SDAH uses the somewhat altered version from Lutheran Book of Worship, 1978, and we are indebted to the companion to that volume for the following biographical sketch.\n\nMELODY. C. M.\nThere is\nland of pure delight,\nWhere saints immortal reign;\nInfinite day\nexcludes the night, And pleasures banish pain.\n\nTwo-part version of TWENTY-FOURTH as it appears in Joshua Leavitt’s Christian Lyre. Notice the sharped leading tone in the second line.\n\nSilas Bettes McManus was born September 17, 1845, at Rootstown, Ohio. On the Bettes side, his grandfather was a captain in the Revolu- tionary War and his grand- mother was a French woman who knew General Lafayette. In 1863 the McManus family moved to Marsh Brook Farm near Lima, Indiana, where Silas lived the rest of his life. He studied medicine at Ft. Wayne Medical College and the University of Michigan, but before entering practice, he gave it up to become an author, writing for several magazines and newspapers. For two years he was a state senator, earning a reputation for his honesty in representing the interests of his constituents. His deep love for the country life was seen in his Rural Rhymes, 1898. He died at Marsh Brook, April 15, 1917.\n\nThe tune TWENTY-FOURTH (also known as PRIMROSE) is called by Erik Routley “one of the finest Common Meter tunes [8.6.8.6.] down” (The Music of Christian Hymns, 1981). It appeared in Wyeth’s Repository of Sacred Music, Part Second, 1813, where it was credited to Chapin, and set to Watts’s “Salvation! Oh, the Joyful Sound.” Several of the Southern shaped-note tune books have included it-William Walker’s Southern Harmony, 1835; Carden’s Missouri Harmony, 1837; and B. F. White’s Sacred Harp, 1844, the present edition of which says it was composed by Amzi Chapin. Recent scholarship seems to indicate that it belongs to his brother, Lucius, born in 1760 in Springfield, Massachusetts, to a family that went all the way back to Samuel Chapin, who came over from England in 1636. In 1775 young Lucius was a fifer in the Continental Army in Boston. He enlisted the following year, fighting in several historic battles. He was with Washington in the terrible winter of 1777 to 1778 at Valley Forge, suffering frostbite that caused him lifelong problems. After the war, he entered a career as a singing school teacher, conducting classes in the New England states. In 1787 he moved to the Shenandoah Valley, Virginia, where he taught in several counties and, as a devout Presbyterian, generally promoted the cause of sacred music. The year 1794 found him on the move again, this time to Vernon, Kentucky. He stayed there for 40 years, but he did some traveling to neighboring states, teaching and singing. It is thought possible that one of his students was Ananias Davisson, the compiler of Kentucky Harmony, 1816. Chapin died December 24, 1842. The Chapin brothers, Amzi and Lucius, were accomplished musicians of their time and made a strong contribution to the hymn singing of this period in America.\n\nIt is easy to recognize the melodic and harmonic similarity of this tune to NEW BRITAIN, which SDAH uses for “Amazing Grace,” No. 108.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "This his hymn, to be sung at the close of the Communion service, addresses what should happen to Christians in the real world as a result of the renewal they have just experienced in the service. Under the nom de plume “J. Clifford Evers,” it first appeared in People’s Mass Book, 1964. In an altered form it was included in Lutheran Book of Worship, 1978.\n\nOmer Westendorf was born on February 24, 1916; he spent most of his life in Cincinnati, Ohio. His education was at the University of Cincinnati, where he earned the B.Mus. and M.Mus. degrees. At age 20 he was appointed organist-choirmaster at St. Bonaventure Church; he has held that for more than 40 years! His ability and versatility have resulted in the following posts, honors, and accomplishments: director of Bonaventure Choir, a group that does radio, television, recording, and concert work; music teacher at several schools; founder and president of World Library of Sacred Music and World Library Publications; consultant on liturgical music; lecturer on aspects of church music; hymn writer and compiler of four hymnals, including People’s Mass Book, 1964, the first hymn and service book in the language of the people, decreed by Vatican Council II; consultant on the publication of Armed Forces Hymnal; and author of Music Lessons for the Man in the Pew, designed to help ordinary people learn how to read music from a score. In 1976 his hymn “Gift of Finest Wheat” won first prize over 200 submitted in a contest to obtain an official hymn for the forty-first International Eucharistic Congress. His article “The State of Catholic Hymnody” appeared in The Hymn in April 1977.\n\nTHE ASH GROVE (see SDAH 560), an eminently singable Welsh folk melody, is here arranged for unison voices by Leland Bernhard Sateren. He was born of Norwegian parents at Everett, Washington, on October 13, 1913. After graduating from Augsburg College in 1935, he taught high school music at Moose Lake, Minnesota. His graduate study was at the University of Minnesota, where he was music director of the radio station on campus. From 1946 to 1979 he was professor of music and director of the Augsburg Choir at Augsburg College, Minneapolis. (He is now serving in that position, emeritus.) Sateren has had a long and distinguished career as a musician in the Lutheran Church, serving on the Inter-Lutheran Commission on Worship from 1967 to 1978, the year Lutheran Book of Worship was published. He has been much sought after as choral clinician, adjudicator, teacher, lecturer, and choir festival director, both in the United States and abroad. Twice he made major studies of the famous choirs of America and Europe. As a composer he is prolific, having written more than 300 choral works. A number of his articles on choirs, choral singing, and hymnology have appeared in professional magazines. Special honors conferred on him include D.H.L. from Gettysburg College; D.Mus. from Lakeland College; King Olav of Norway in 1971; and the first the St. Olaf Medal, conferred F. Melius Christiansen Memorial Award of the Minnesota chapter of the American Choral Directors Association, 1974. During the 1975-1976 academic year he served on the faculty of the Conservatory of Music, Bergen, Norway, as choral director and teacher of conducting and composition. Since retirement in 1979, his schedule is filled with composing, arranging, writing, translating (he has just completed a new biography of Edvard Grieg), conducting in America and Europe, adjudicating, and lecturing, without, as he says, “having committee meetings, exams to give, papers to correct, a college music department to administer, rehearsals to conduct, recitals to attend, all of which I thoroughly enjoyed, but which required 48-hour days!” SDAH also has Sateren’s tune REGWALL, with “As Saints of Old,” SDAH 556. For a four-part harmony version of THE ASH GROVE, see SDAH 560.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "In 1874 George Hugh Bourne printed Seven Post Communion Hymns, a pamphlet for the use of St. Edmunds College, Salisbury, England. It contained this hymn of 10 stanzas under the heading, “The Memorial of Thine Abundant Kindness Shall be Shewed.” Its first use in a standard hymnal was in the 1889 Supplement to Hymns Ancient and Modern.\n\nGeorge Hugh Bourne was born November 8, 1840, at St. Paul’s, Cray, Kent, England. He was educated at Eton and Corpus Christi College, Oxford, earning a D.C.L. degree in 1871. Ordained a deacon in 1863 and a priest of the Anglican Church in 1864, he held the following positions: assistant curate of Sandford-on-Thames; headmaster and warden of St. Andrew’s, Chardstock (later moved to St. Edmund’s, Salisbury); chaplain to the bishop of Bloemfontein; and subdean, treasurer, and prebendary of Salisbury Cathedral. He wrote many hymns and translated others, but this is the only one that survives. He died at Salisbury on December 1, 1925.\n\nKINGLEY VALE was written for this text to be used in the B.B.C. Hymn Book, 1951, for which the composer was committee chairman.\n\nHugh Percy Allen was born at Reading, England, on December 23, 1869. At the age of 11 he was already playing well enough to be organist at St. Savior’s Church, and became assistant music master at Wellington College and assistant organist for Chichester Cathedral at age 18. In 1892 he was elected an organ scholar at Cambridge, and earned the D. Mus. at Oxford in 1898. After organ posts at St. Asaph’s and Ely cathedrals, he went to New College, Oxford, as organist, and spent the rest of his life in building up music program there. In addition, he directed the London Bach Choir for 13 years, served as director of the Royal College of Music for a time, and conducted popular hymn-singing festivals. For his distinguished services to music, he was knighted in 1920. A street accident in Oxford took his life in his seventy-seventh year on February 20, 1946.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "Only the first two lines of this hymn for Communion are identical with a hymn written by Isaac Watts (1674-1748; see Biographies), which appears in his 1707 Hymns and Spiritual Songs, Part III, No. 2. It is titled appears “Communion With Christ, and With Saints, 1 Cor. 10:16, 17.” So the hymn as it appears in SDAH is only one-twelfth Watts’s. The change was made in the 1886 Hymns and Tunes and perpetuated in Church Hymnal, 1941. Watts’s words paraphrase 1 Corinthians 10:16, 17; and Colossians 1:18.\n\nSCHUMANN appears in Cantica Laudis, 1850, a collection published in Boston by Lowell Mason (see Biographies) and George Webb (see SDAH 618). It was designed to raise the standards of American hymnody by adapting selections from classical music. The tune is thought to be taken from the works of Robert Schumann (1810-1856; see SDAH 541), the famous German composer of songs, orchestral symphonies, and chamber music. SCHUMANN is also used for SDAH 670; another arrangement by this composer appears at SDAH 541, 548, and 686.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "These words by an unknown author are a cogent summary of the ceremony and meaning of the Communion service. The expression “broken body,” which comes from 1 Corinthians 11:24, is capable of wrong interpretation, for “a bone of him shall not be broken” (John 19:36). So the Scripture allusion is to Luke 22:19, “This is my body which is given for you.” Hence the breaking of the bread indicates that it was given for all to share in its blessings.\n\nThe hymn was first printed in Phineas A. Smith’s Second Advent Hymn Book, 1850. Two years later James White included it in Hymns for Second Advent Believers, and it has been in several SDA books since then.\n\nThe tune JANICE was named by the composer, Wayne Hooper,; see Biographies) in honor of his daughter. He wrote it for a Communion service in 1966 when he was minister of music at the Vallejo Drive SDA Church, Glendale, California. He revised it slightly for inclusion\nin this hymnal.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

Ordained a Congregational minister in 1951, he served churches at Knowle, Warwickshire, and a supplement to Leicester, England. This hymn is taken from Congregational Praise, which was compiled in 1964 for use at the Congregational Church of Roborough.\n\nDAY OF PRAISE was first published in the Supplemental Hymn and Tune Book, 1869. The name comes from its early association with the John Ellerton hymn “Our Day of Praise Is Done.”\n\nCharles Steggall was born June 3, 1826, in London; he entered the Royal Academy of Music, where he studied under Sterndale Bennett. While still a student, he played the organ at Christ Church, Maida Avenue. In 1851 he earned the D. Mus. at Cambridge and was the first professor of organ at the Royal Academy of Music, a post he held for 50 years! One of the founders of the Royal College of Organists, he was also the first secretary of the London Bach Society. Other positions he held were organist at Christ’s Church, Lancaster Gate, and at Lincoln’s Inn Chapel; and examiner in music at Cambridge from 1882. His compositions included anthems, church music, and hymn tunes. He edited Hymns for the Church of England, 1868, and was in charge of the music for the 1904 edition of Hymns Ancient and Modern. He died at Lambeth, London, on June 7, 1905.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "historicalContext": "This hymn by George Wallace Briggs (1875-1959; see SDAH 261) was accepted by the Hymn Society of America and published in their Ten New Bible Hymns, 1953. A number of changes have been made, mostly to modernize archaic language.\n\nThe tune TON-Y-BOTEL, more correctly called EBENEZER, was composed in 1890 by Thomas John Williams (1869-1944). The tune name “tune-in-a-bottle,” from a mythical story of its discovery. It was actually a portion of an anthem titled “Light in the Valley.” The form of the melody is AABA, making it very easy to learn and sing. (See SDAH 606, where the closer printing of this tune makes this form more obvious.) Williams was born at Ynysmeudwy, Wales; he studied music at Cardiff, and became organist-choirmaster of Zion Church, Llanelly, 1903-1913. He wrote many hymn tunes and some anthems. He died at Llanelly, Carmarthenshire, on April 24, 1944.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "The text is based on Galatians 5:22, 23: “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.” Timothy Dudley-Smith (1926- uses most skillfully the “fruit of the tree” imagery to show how all these good results in our lives can come only if the “tree” is rooted in Christ our Saviour and is tended by the Holy Spirit. He wrote it in August 1981 while on a holiday at the village of Ruan Minor in the Cornwall section of England. After reading the above Bible text, he copied into his manuscript book an analysis of these fruits, from a variety of English translations of the New Testament. Nearly all the versions agreed on “love,” “joy,” and “peace,” but there was divergence on the words for “longsuffering” and “meekness.” He decided to follow the Revised Standard Version and use the modern words for these fruits of the Spirit. His suggestion was to use Stainer’s tune.\n\nALL FOR JESUS is the final chorale from John Stainer’s Crucifixion, composed for the choir of Marylebone Parish Church (London) and first performed there in 1887. The tune name comes from the first words of the chorale.\n\nStainer was born in Southwark, London, June 1840. At the age of 7, already accomplished at the organ, he became a chorister at St. Paul’s Cathedral. During the nine years he was there, some of his compositions wers used in the service, and he often played the organ. At 14, he was appointed organist at St. Benedict and St. Peter’s, Paul’s Wharf, and at 16 was promoted to organist at St. Michael’s College, near Tenbury, Worcestershire. Entering Oxford in 1859 at age 19, he earned the M.A. and B.Mus. degrees while serving as organist for Magdalen College Chapel, and later for University College. In 1872 he succeeded Sir John Goss (see SDAH 4) as organist- choirmaster at St. Paul’s, and was recognized for his ability as a choral director and for setting a standard of excellence at St. Paul’s that was the finest in all England. Other posts held with distinction were: professor of organ, and then principal of the National Training School for Music (now the Royal College of Music); organist for the Royal Choral Society; government inspector of music in training schools; professor of music at the University of Oxford. Retiring in 1899, he was made master of the Musician’s Company. At age 48 he gave up his post at St. Paul’s because of failing eyesight, and in the same year was knighted by Queen Victoria. He died March 31, 1901, while on a visit to Italy.\n\nHe wrote more than 150 hymn tunes; many anthems; several cantatas; the books The Music of the Bible and A Treatise on Harmony; and textbooks on the organ, composition, and musical terms. Hymnbooks that were the beneficiary of his editorial knowledge were Church Chant Book, 1891; Church Hymnary, 1898; and several editions of Hymns Ancient and Modern.\n\nErik Routley (see SDAH 13) has characterized Stainer as a “matchless part-writer, contrapuntist and handler of the musical language; essentially a church musician, modest about his own work, admiring others more than himself.” One musical oddity he left us is the hymn tune PER RECTE ET RETRO, which can be sung and played backward without changing any notes; the melody is the same either way! It has been judged almost useless as a hymn tune, but a real feat of musical engineering. It can be found in Erik Routley’s The Music of Christian Hymns, 1981, and in the Episcopal Hymnal 1940 Companion.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "author": "C. Mervyn Maxwell",
    "authorBirthDeath": "1925–1999",
    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "This is a unique hymn of three stanzas that gives us a chance to sing of three major events in the ministry of our Lord that have in common the phrase “on the clouds.” C. Mervyn Maxwell wrote the following as his purpose in writing the hymn:\n\n“When I began teaching the development of Seventh-day Adventist beliefs at the SDA Theological Seminary, 1968, I suddenly realized the essential relationship of 1844 to the existence and message of our movement. We Adventists believe that Christ is coming soon because we believe that in 1844 the final judgment began [the first angel’s message, Revelation 14]. Awareness of the shortness of time available this side of 1844 contributes greatly to our impelling sense of world mission. And because we are living in the antitypical day of atonement, we believe our lifestyle should be appropriate to the Christ-centered experience that Leviticus 16 calls “afflicting the soul.” Such considerations and others led me to take a second look at Daniel 7:9-14 and to see in it a dramatic, cosmic, Christ-on-the-clouds event comparable in style and possibly in magnitude to the Second Coming. Seventh-day Adventist pioneers and prominent early preachers likewise called attention to the dramatic literal wording of the passage.” The following explanation may be helpful to a congregation singing the hymn for the first time: stanza 1 is based on Matthew 28:18-20; Luke 24:50, 51: and Acts 1:9. Stanza 2 is based on Daniel 7:9-14 (compare Early Writings by E. G. White, pp. 54-56). Stanza 3 is based on Matthew 24:30; 1 Thessalonians 4:16; and Revelation 1:7.\n\nMaxwell continues: “This hymn is offered in the interest of the sanctuary message, which has been described as the ‘foundation of our faith’ [Ellen G. White manuscript 20, 1906]. The particular point of the hymn is the correlation of biblical language used to describe Christ’s ascent to heaven, His second coming, and His 1844 approach to the Ancient of Days. Indeed, identical language is used in Daniel 7:13 for His approach to the investigative judgment, and in Matthew 24:30 for His second coming. Without question, Adventists believe in the historicity of Christ’s cloudy ascent to heaven and in the reality of His forthcoming cloudy return from heaven. Calling attention to the similarity of language for all three events helps to confirm the historicity and reality of the 1844 event.”\n\nAt first, the committee chose the tune UNSER HERRSCHER (see SDAH 45 and 418) to go with this text, but when Maxwell revealed that he Wrote “with CWM RHONDDA churning in my brain,” it was decided to use the strong Welsh tune that inspired him. (CWM RHONDDA is also used for SDAH 201 and 538.)\n\nC. Mervyn Maxwell was born in 1925 in England, but moved to Mountain View, California, in 1936 at age 11 when his father, Arthur S. Maxwell (“Uncle Arthur” of Bedtime Stories fame), was called to be editor of Signs of the Times. Mervyn earned the B.A. at Pacific Union College, 1946; an M.A. at SDA Theological Seminary, 1951; and a Ph.D. at the University of Chicago, 1966. For nine years he pastored California churches, and for years taught religion at Union College, Lincoln, Nebraska. Since 1968 he has chaired the Department of Church History, Andrews University, Berrien Springs, Michigan. Distribution of books authored by Maxwell total about 500,000: Man, What a God!; Look at It This Way, answering youth’s questions; Moving Out and Tell It to the World, histories of the SDA denomination; and God Cares, a two-volume set on the messages of Daniel and Revelation for “you and your family.” His wife, Pauline (Weitz), of Lodi, California, is a church organist and teaches music privately.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Roswell Fenner Cottrell (1814-1892; see SDAH 179) wrote these words, which emphasize one of the distinctive doctrines of Seventh-day Adventists, the investigative (or pre-Advent) judgment. They appear in Hymns and Tunes, 1886, and cite many Scripture texts. Cottrell I also wrote SDAH 179, “The Wonders of Redeeming Love.”\n\nThis is one of the texts sent out by the committee to some 30 SDA composers, asking for an original tune. The submission by Allen W. Foster (1940-; see SDAH 151) was chosen for its fitting solemnity, and the dramatic power of its harmonic progressions. The composer shares these thoughts about the tune FINALLY, “The inspiration for the writing of the tune setting for this magnificent text by R. F. Cottrell was derived from both the very recent need for a tune and the inspiration received from just a reading awe-producing text. The tune seemed natural to the meter, and while the key is major, the feeling seems reflective or retrospective, almost in a minor mode. The choice of the hymn name, FINALLY, is derived from a personal perception of spiritual retrospection realized from the text. At the writing of these words, I’ve just recently suffered the death of my only brother, a gifted attorney, who at age 46 died very suddenly on September 8, 1984. To his memory, this hymn tune is dedicated.”\n\nFoster arranged the spiritual SDAH 151, “Jesus Walked This Lonesome Valley”; and composed SDAH 203, CHALLENGE; and SDAH 298, BRADLEY.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Dating from c. 1225, the Latin hymn “Dies Irae” is based on Zephaniah 1:14, 15: “The great day of the Lord is near. That day is a day of wrath, a day of clouds and thick darkness.” John Julian, in his Dictionary of Hymnology, 1907, tells of the universal acceptance of this hymn: “The hold which this sequence [words or stanzas following the regular prescribed reading of the Mass service] has had It has been translated upon the minds of men has been very great… It has been translated into many languages, those in German numbering about 90, and those in English about 160. In Great Britain and America no hymnbook of any note has appeared in the past hundred years without the ‘Dies Irae’ being directly or indirectly represented therein.... Daniel, a German writer,… says, ‘Even those to whom the hymns of the Latin church are almost entirely unknown, certainly know this one.””\n\nLiterally hundreds of composers down through the centuries have been challenged to set these dramatic words to music. As evidence that interest in the subject of the judgment has been waning, the SDAH Committee found, in the hymnbooks used by major denominations today, only one version of this hymn on the judgment-“The Day Is Surely Drawing Near,” in Lutheran Book of Worship, 1978. (The Episcopal Hymnal 1940 has a translation beginning “Day of wrath! O day of mourning.”)\n\nUnder the date of June 1775, this entry appears in the diary of John Newton (1725-1807; see Biographies): “Sunday, 26th, spoke in the evening from a hymn on the day of judgment.” Previously he had mentioned the hymn, and said it took him two days to write. It was first published in Olney Hymns, 1779, which he worked on with poet William Cowper (see SDAH 107).\n\nThe great British hymnologist Samuel Duffield, in his English Hymns, 1888, tells how the hymn might have been written: “John Newton sailed from Liverpool in August 1750 as commander of a staunch ship.... Having since he was taken to sea by his father (a sea captain), in his eleventh year. By leisure, he now revived his studies, which had been practically suspended the help of a Latin dictionary he attacked the classics, and mastered Horace, Juvenal, Livy, Caesar, and Sallust. He added to this list in the space of two or three voyages, and read Terence, Virgil, Cicero, and such modern writers as Englishman and Buchanan.... It must have been in some such manner that he gradually fell in with the Latin hymns-at least with the ‘Dies Irae,’ for the present hymn is nothing if not a paraphrase of that grand sequence.”\n\nThe tune UNSER HERRSCHER, also used for SDAH 45, “Open Now Thy Gates of Beauty,” was written by Joachim Neander (1650-1680; see Biographies), for the German text “Unser Herrscher, unser König” (Our Ruler, Our King) and published in the original edition of his works entitled Alpha and Omega, 1680. There were 19 of his melodies in that book. In some hymnals this tune is variously called NEANDER, MAGDEBURG, or EPHESUS.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "This text first appeared in a hymnal published by the American Northern Baptists in 1864, where authorship is credited to Horatius Bonar (1808-1889; see SDAH 79). He had a firm belief in the literal second coming of Christ, and used these scriptures: “For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised” (1 Cor. 15:52), “Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust” (Isa. 26:19); “It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power” (1 Cor. 15:43). The hymn was used in four more hymnals up to the year 1886, but in none from there to 1978.\n\nThe composer of UNITED MAN, Norman Warren, was born in 1934 in London and has a Master of Arts in Music from Cambridge University. He is presently rector of one of the largest Church of England parishes in southwest London. He is married and the father of five children. Publications include many hymn tunes found in books all over the world; choir anthems; and an evangelistic booklet titled Journey Into Life, of which more than 6 million copies have been sold in the English version, besides translations into 67 languages. His latest work is an evangelistic paperback, What’s the Point?\n\nFrom his home in Morden, Surrey, he writes that the tune “UNITED MAN was originally written for a beautiful metrical version of Psalm 133, hence the title of the tune as the psalm is about unity. My title [tune name] was a joke. In England our most famous football team is Manchester United, known as ‘Man United.’ The sharp-eyed editors spotted this when I called the tune MAN UNITED and swapped the words around!\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Joseph Bromehead (1747-1826) published, in 1795, the Eckington Psalms and Hymns, in which this hymn appears. In the preface he expresses with regret his inability to name the authors of many of the selections; this one is identified simply by the initials F.B.P. This probably refers to Francis Baker, pater (or priest), a Roman Catholic imprisoned for his faith in the Tower of London during the sixteenth century. Some Roman Catholic authorities state that the author was Father Laurence Anderton, who lived during the reign of King Charles I.\n\nA British Museum manuscript, which is undated but of the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century, gives a text of 26 four-line stanzas under the title “A Song Made by F.B.P. To the Tune of Diana.” SDAH stanzas are Nos. 1, 7, 17, the two latter altered; the fourth stanza is from some other source. The committee chose to use these four stanzas as they appeared in the SDA Hymns and Tunes, 1869.\n\nLAND OF REST is a tune Annabel Buchanan heard as a child when her grandmother, Sarah Ann (Love) Foster, sang it with the words, “O land of rest, for thee I sigh.” It had been printed with those words in J. R. Graves’ Little Seraph in 1873. It is thought to be of Scottish origin, and it certainly has that “flavor.” Very popular through the Appalachian mountain region, it was arranged by Buchanan and included in her Folk Hymns of America, 1938. Because of the obvious similarities in the melodies, she thinks the spiritual “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot” may be derived from this tune. It is almost all in the pentatonic (five-note) scale. A version of this tune is in the 1844 Original Sacred Harp, attributed to W. S. Turner and titled NEW PROSPECT.\n\nAnnabel Morris Buchanan was born October 22, 1888, in Groesbeck, Texas; she graduated in 1907 from Landon Conservatory of Music, Dallas. After study of composition, organ, and piano with private teachers in New York City, she taught all these subjects in colleges in Oklahoma, Texas, and Virginia. Her main claim to fame has been her activity with the Federation of Music Clubs and in the contribution she has made in collecting, arranging, and publishing American folk music. She has written articles on her research for many periodicals, and a number of books, including American Folk Music and Book of American Composers. Her private collection of books, recordings, and manuscripts are now in the library of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. After she broke her hip, she lived in a convalescent center in Paducah, Kentucky, and died in 1983.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

The hymn was entitled “A Cloud of Witnesses,” referring, of course, to the heroes of faith mentioned by the apostle Paul in Hebrews 11, together with all their spiritual descendants who have proclaimed, witnessed, and died for the Christian faith. Their noble example constitutes an ever-present challenge to Christians today. There were 11 stanzas in the original hymn.\n\nSINE NOMINE (Without a Name) was composed in 1906 by Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872-1958; see Biographies) especially for these words, and named by him. It was first used in English Hymnal, 1906, where the composer modestly marked it “Anon.” It is considered one of the greatest hymn tunes of the twentieth century.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

This, together with the 6/8 time and an added refrain of words and music, transformed the hymn into a gospel song.

The eight lines omitted are the last halves of the original third and fourth stanzas, so SDAH’s third stanza consists of the first halves of the original third and fourth stanzas.\n\nAUSTRIA was composed by Franz Joseph Haydn (1732-1809; see SDAH 96) specifically for words written by Lorenzo Leopold Haschka as the first national anthem for Austria. The words were “Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser” (God Save the Emperor Francis). On his visits to London, Haydn had been greatly impressed by the British national anthem and its effect upon the people. He was stimulated to write this stirring tune, which was first played in Vienna on the emperor’s birthday, February 12, 1797. The theme was later used by Haydn in the variations in the slow movement of his string quartet in C, Opus 76, No. 3 (Emperor Quartet). It is quite possible that Haydn had heard the melody in his childhood days at Rohrau, a town on a tributary of the river Danube, for it is a Croatian folk song.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "This gospel song of hope in eternal life with Christ was first copyrighted in 1915 by the composer; it is one of those the committee voted to bring back from Gospel in Song, 1926.\n\nWilliam Charles Poole was born April 14, 1875, in Easton, Maryland, to parents who were farmers; he was converted to Christ at age 11. After receiving his education at Washington College, Chestertown, Maryland, he was ordained a Methodist preacher in 1900, and faithfully served as pastor for 35 years in the Wilmington Conference. As a boy he composed verse, and during his life as a preacher he wrote many religious articles, more than 500 gospel hymns, and sacred poetry. He was prominent in the temperance cause, and at one time was superintendent of the Delaware Anti-Saloon League. He died December 24, 1949.\n\nHe wrote many of his songs after being encouraged by composer Charles H. Gabriel (see SDAH 435), who composed music for Poole’s text for SDAH 512, “Just When I Need Him Most.”\n\nPoole said: “My real work is that of a minister and pastor. The writing is done as recreation and diversion from responsibilities that might otherwise depress me. The same idea that sends me to the pulpit sends me to my pen or typewriter-to help somebody.”\n\nB. D. Ackley (1872-1958; see SDAH 311) was organist for churches in New York and Pennsylvania, pianist for the evangelist Billy several Sunday, a Methodist minister, and a music editor who composed music for more than 3,000 gospel songs. He said he composed this one in Philadelphia during a period of “stressing grind and hard work.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "The composer of the tune of this hymn, Joseph Philbrick Webster of New Hampshire, was a very sensitive musician, subject to fits of depression in which he would completely ignore even his best friends. He played the violin and other instruments and was a prolific composer of secular songs. An active member of the Handel and Haydn Society in Boston, in the early 1850s he migrated to Indiana and then in 1857 further west, settling in Elkhorn Wisconsin.\n\nFour years later Sanford Fillmore Bennett (1836-1898), formerly an editor and teacher in Eden, New York, became a medical practitioner in Elkhorn and also pursued his hobby of writing verse. The two men became acquainted and set up a partnership of writing secular songs, but with Bennett’s time fairly occupied in his practice, there were not enough lyrics to keep Webster in full time employment writing the tunes. The enforced idleness accentuated his melancholia. One day in 1867 Webster visited Bennett’s office. He turned his back on his friend and said nothing, not even a word of greeting. Realizing that Webster was in one of his moods of dejection, Bennett asked what was the matter. “Oh, nothing,” was the gloomy reply. “It will be all right and by.”\n\nThe answer immediately started a train of thought in Bennett’s mind as he considered the spiritual implications of the remark. “The sweet by and by,” he said. “Wouldn’t that make a good hymn?” He sat down at his table and within half an hour had produced these three stanzas and a refrain. He handed the words to Webster, who brightened up at once, caught the inspiration of the moment, and quickly composed a melody for the words. He played it on his violin and then added the harmony. Meanwhile, two townsmen had come into the office. They joined with Webster and Bennett in singing the new hymn, and it has remained a favorite ever since.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "Bernard of Cluny was born of English parents, it is said, in Morlaix in Brittany, northern France. Others say that the name of this town was misspelled and that he was born at Morlaàs, which is in the extreme south of France. Bernard lived in the twelfth century; his birth and death dates are not known. He entered the monastery of Cluny, near Lyon, France, founded in A.D. 910, and remained there for the rest of his life. Life in the monastery was luxurious compared with the poverty and misery in the outside world. That fact, and the corruption and evil of this present world as compared with the glories of the New Jerusalem, led Bernard, in about A.D. 1145, to write a satire on the state of the world.\n\nHis poem extended to almost 3,000 lines. Entitled “De Contemptu Mundi” (On Disdain of the World), it was written in an unusual meter, dactylic hexameters. A dactyl is a foot of three syllables; long, short, short; and hexameter is six of these, although one of them can be a spondee (two long syllables) or a trochee (long, short). Bernard said that he believed that only the inspiration of the Spirit of God enabled him to write the poem in this meter. It was, of course, in Latin, and begins: Hóra novissima, témpora péssima súnt; vigilémus (the accents have been supplied), which means “recent times are the worst times; let us watch.”\n\nVarious translators have retained this meter, for example, Samuel W. Duffield in 1867:\n\nThese are the latter times,\nThese are not better times;\nLet us stand waiting.\n\nOr Jackson Mason in 1860:\n\nEarth very evil is;\nTime through the last of his\nJourneys is hasting.\n\nOr Gerard Moultrie in 1865:\n\nHere we have many fears,\nThis is a vale of tears,\nThe land of sorrow;\nTears are there none at all\nIn that celestial hall,\nIn life’s bright morrow.\n\nA similar meter and lilt, but not always in hexameters, occur in some of Tennyson’s lines in his “Charge of the Light Brigade”:\n\nTheir’s not to reason why,\nTheir’s but to do or die,\nNoble six hundred.\n\nIn 1849 John Mason Neale (1818-1866; see Biographies) translated about 200 lines from Bernard’s poem, calling it “The Rhythm of the Heavenly Country.” It appeared in his Medieval Hymns, 1851, and from it are taken this hymn and also the hymns “Brief Life Is Here Our Portion,” “The World Is Very Evil,” and SDAH 424, “For Thee, O Dear, Dear Country.” There were 43 stanzas, mostly of eight lines each; the SDAH hymn begins with stanza 29.\n\nEWING is named after its composer, Alexander Ewing who composed it in 1853 especially for the words of SDAH 424, “For Thee, O Dear, Dear Country.” It was originally in 3/4 time, but in 1861 in Hymns Ancient and Modern it was changed to the present rhythm. The range in the soprano is unusually great, namely, an octave and a third, from middle C to E. Ewing was a member of the Aberdeen Harmonic Choir. He handed his new composition to the conductor, William Carnie, to try out, and it was an immediate success.\n\nEwing was born on January 3, 1830, at Old Machar in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. He studied law at first, but turned to music. He went to Heidelberg to study and was a good pianist, cellist, and cornetist. However, music was still only a hobby. When the Crimean War broke out in 1853 he served at Constantinople and rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. He later served in the Chinese campaigns of 1860-1862. From 1867 to 1869 he commanded a regiment in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada. He was also assistant cathedral organist, choir member, and conductor of a choral society there. Then he served for 10 years in south Australia. He retired in 1889 to Taunton in Somerset, England, and died there on July 11, 1895. He wrote five anthems, some part-songs, and madrigals, but only this one hymn tune.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

At the time a fierce epidemic was raging, and his heart ached at seeing so many mourners in the streets who had laid their loved ones to rest. As he was meditating, this question came into his mind: “At the parting of the river of death, shall we meet again at the river of life?” He was doubtless reminded of the revelator’s description of the heavenly city: “He shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb” (Rev. 22:1). Lowry went to his organ and spontaneously composed both words and music of this hymn.\n\nIt is recognized as “classic” gospel song, with dotted rhythms and repeated harmonies. American composer Aaron Copeland used the tune for his “At the for solo voice and piano, sung by many concert artists.\nRiver”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Henry Alford wrote three stanzas of this hymn, which appeared in his Year of Praise, 1867; he wrote the fourth stanza in 1870. It is, as it were, a prophetic vision of the future, when sin shall be no more. It was intended as a funeral hymn, depicting the future glories of the deceased, thus providing an antidote to the gloom and sadness that often accompanies a bereavement.\n\nAlford was born at Bedford Row, Holborn, London, on October 7, 1810. He studied at Cambridge University, graduating with honors in 1832. In 1833 he was ordained in the Anglican Church and was appointed as curate to the small village of Ampton, 28 miles from Cambridge. From 1835 to 1853 he was curate of Wymeswold, north of Leicester. From 1853 to 1857 he served in the Quebec Chapel, London. He served as dean of Canterbury Cathedral from 1857 until his death in that city on January 12, 1871. He was a profound Greek scholar and is remembered for his edition of the Greek New Testament, a labor of 20 years. He wrote many hymns and poems, and translations and compilations of hymns. He also wrote SDAH 557, “Come, Ye Thankful People.”\n\nALFORD, named for the author of the words, was especially composed for this text by John Bacchus Dykes (1823-1876; see Biographies). It was first published in the revised Hymns Ancient and Modern, 1875.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "Elizabeth Mills was reading a commentary by Bridges on Psalm 119:44: “So shall I keep thy law continually for ever.” Bridges had made the note, “We speak of heaven, but oh, to be there!” These words gave her the inspiration to write this hymn on the glories of the New Jerusalem. Originally there were six stanzas of four lines each, but in Stevenson’s Hymns for Children, 1877, he includes only five; he gives the fifth, omitted in SDAH, in a footnote, which also tells of the origin of the hymn. This stanza is:\n\nWe speak of its anthems of praise,\nWith which we can never compare\nThe sweetest on earth we can raise –\nBut what must it be to be there?\n\nElizabeth Mills, née King, was born in Stoke Newington, north London, in 1805. She died in Finsbury Place, London, on April 21, 1829, only three weeks after writing the hymn, giving particular poignancy to lines three and four of the fourth stanza.\n\nCONTRAST is attributed to Lewis Edson (1784-1820) and is so named because it was used for a hymn by John Newton that had several contrasts in its text. It is an early American melody for a secular Ye Green Fields and Sweet Groves” of about the year 1772. It appeared later entitled “Farewell, song in several shaped-note tune books. Edson, a blacksmith of Massachusetts and Connecticut, conducted singing schools, and was himself a well-known singer.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "yearWritten": 1900,
    "historicalContext": "Both words and music of this gospel song were written by Charles Gabriel in one evening in 1900. They were prompted by the word glory, which Ed Card, the superintendent of the Sunshine Rescue Mission in St. Louis, Missouri, used frequently during meetings. Card also used the word in his prayers, earnestly and convincingly, and would invariably end his prayers with “and that will be glory for me.” His reverent use of these words earned him the nickname of “Old Glory Face.” Gabriel wrote his words around this theme. The song first appeared in E. O. Excell’s Make His Praise Glorious. It resembles most gospel songs by having a singable melody, an alto part generally a third or a sixth below, and much repetition in the tenor and bass parts.\n\nCharles Hutchinson Gabriel, who sometimes used Charlotte G. Homer as a pseudonym, was born on August 18, 1856, in Wilton, Iowa. He taught himself how to play the reed organ in the farm home. In his book Sixty Years of Gospel Song he said, “I told my mother that someday I would write a song of my own, and I shall never forget her reply: ‘My boy, I would rather have you write a song that would help somebody, than see you president of the United States.’ Although I was then a mere lad, her words became the anchor of my ambition.” He taught his first singing school at 16, and wrote his first song at age 17. For two years he was music director for Grace Methodist Church, San Francisco; in 1895 he moved to Chicago and became a publisher. Later he associated with the Rodeheaver Hall-Mack Company, a relationship that he maintained until his death on September 15, 1932, at age 76.\n\nBetween 1910 and 1920, Gabriel composed many gospel songs for the Billy Sunday-Rodeheaver evangelistic campaigns, doing most of his work at night while others were sleeping. As a compiler and editor he was involved in the production of 35 books of gospel songs, five Sabbath school books, seven male voice books, six women’s voice books, 10 books for children, 19 books of anthems, 23 choir cantatas, 41 Santa Claus cantatas, 10 juvenile cantatas, four operettas, two reed organ instruction books, and four piano books. His other tunes in SDAH are No. 512, “Just When I Need Him Most,” and No. 625, “Higher Ground.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "This hymn was written by three men named William! A look at the indexes of authors and composers in SDAH will reveal that that name is the one that appears most often.\n\nWilliam Hunter (1811-1877), a Methodist preacher, educator, and hymnbook editor, also wrote SDAH 254, “The Great Physician.” “I’m Going Home” was written in 1838 and had five stanzas. It was published in editions of the Methodist Hymnal dated 1878 and 1905; in the SDA hymnbook Hymns and Tunes, 1886; and in the recent Great Hymns of Faith, compiled and edited by John W. Peterson and published by Singspiration, Inc. In this latter book, William Miller (1801-1878) is given credit for composing the music, and a William McDonald for making the arrangement. We have no information about either of these men, but it is almost certain that this Miller is not the famous preacher of the Second Advent message in the 1840s. There is no record of the latter having been a musician or composing any music.\n“I’m Going Home,” as it was printed in James White’s 1860 supplement to the Advent and Sabbath Hymn Book.\n\nIn the 1971 edition of the Original Sacred Harp, virtually this same music is printed with Watts’s text “Why Should We Start, and Fear to Die.” The whole is credited to “Elder E. Dumas, 1856… assisted B. F. White in the revision of the Sacred Harp in 1869.” It is there in the key of A major; the tune name is TO DIE NO MORE.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "This song was one of the best known and loved of those that were sung by the Millerites. This was a group led by preacher William Miller, who not only believed in the second coming of Christ as a literal event but set the date for it to happen, first in 1843, then in October 1844. The song was sung by some at cemeteries where the Millerites gathered to be near deceased friends and relatives, hoping to ascend with them to heaven following their resurrection.\n\nThe first appearance of this lengthy hymn of nine stanzas was in Joshua Himes’ Millennial Harp, 1843. (See reprint of this on page 436; the music is in two-part harmony, and the original text has “While the old church yards hear the band of music which is sounding through the air.”) James White, one of the early pioneers of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, was a good singer and used the power of song in his public meetings. In his book Life Incidents, he tells of using this song in the year 1843:\n\n“Litchfield Plains [Maine] was my next place of labor. The house was crowded the first evening. In fact, it was with difficulty that I found my way to the pulpit. To call the people to order, the first words they heard from me were in singing,\n\nYou will see your Lord a coming,\nYou will see your Lord a coming,\nYou will see your Lord a coming,\nIn a few more days,\nWhile a band of music,\nWhile a band of music,\nWhile a band of music,\nShall be chanting through the air.\n\n“The reader certainly cannot see poetic merit in the repetition of these simple lines. And if he has never heard the sweet melody to which they were attached, he will be at a loss to see how one voice could employ them so as to hold nearly a thousand persons in almost breathless silence. But it is a fact that there was in those days a power in what was called Advent singing, such as was felt in no other. It seemed to me that not a hand or foot moved in all the crowd before me till I had finished all the words of this lengthy melody. Many wept, and the state of feeling was most favorable for the introduction of the grave subject for the evening. The house was crowded three times each day, and a deep impression was made upon the entire community.”\n\nG. B. Haining remembered hearing White sing the song, and 50 years later he wrote from memory these words for the Ellen G. White Estate in Washington, D.C.:\n\nChorus:\n1. When the heavenly, heavenly music\nWill go sounding through the air.\n2. Have you given your heart to Jesus\nFor that great day?\n3. Don’t delay your preparation\nfor that great day.\n4. Will you spurn His offered pardon\nFor that great day?\n5. Then you’ll wish you’d been converted\nIn that great day.\n6. Then you’ll cry for the rocks and mountains\nIn that great day.\n7. Then you’ll hear the trumpet sounding\nin that great day.\n\nIt was this version that Wayne Hooper used to make his published choral arrangement and the one found in Advent Youth Sing, 1977.\n\nStill another version, with a different set of words, can be found in The Seventh-day Adventist Hymn and Tune Book, 1886, known as Hymns and Tunes, under the title “Choir of Angels.” Whereas all the other versions consist of one line repeated three times for each stanza, here all four lines are different.\n\nEllen Jane Lorenz, in her Glory, Hallelujah! the Story of the Campmeeting Spiritual, Abingdon, 1978, says the tune carried the name THE OLD CHURCH YARD or THE OLD GRANITE STATE, and was sung by the famous “Singing Hutchinson Family” of New Hampshire. It was published mainly in Adventist hymnbooks from 1842 and onward.\n\nThe hymnal committee asked Wayne Hooper (1920-; see Biographies) to base this present arrangement on the original melody found in Millennial Harp, 1843, in order to preserve this song that has so much significance in the history of the SDA Church.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": 1853,
    "historicalContext": "This early Advent hymn was written in 1853 by Annie Rebekah Smith; it appeared in the Review and Herald of November 29 of that year. There was one other stanza:\n\n4. How far from home? ah, then, I cried\nTo God, who marks each plaintive sigh:\nA still, small voice, within, replied,\nNot far from home am I!\nThen weep no more, though round thy way\nAfflictions rise, and doubt and fear,\nWhile myriad voices sweetly say,\nThe pilgrim’s home is near.\n\nThis stanza underlines the structure of the hymn, which pictures the pilgrim asking first the watchman, then the warrior, then the signs in heaven and earth, and finally God. It closes with a confident statement of nearness to the eternal home, instead of with a question. The chief Scripture allusion is to Isaiah 21:11, 12: “Watchman, what of the night? The watchman said, The morning cometh.”\n\nAnnie Smith, only daughter of Samuel and Rebekah Spalding Smith, was born at West Wilton, New Hampshire, on March 16, 1828. She joined the Baptist Church in 1838 and became a follower of William Miller, but after the disappointment of October 1844 she lost interest in the doctrine of the second advent of Christ. She trained to be a teacher, later specializing in painting. In 1851, while she was at Charlestown, Massachusetts, she received a letter from her mother inviting her to attend a meeting to be conducted by Joseph Bates in Somerville, two miles away. She decided to go to please her mother. She dreamed that she did go, arrived late, sat near the door, and heard a sermon on the 2300 days of Daniel 8:14. On the evening of the actual meeting she started in good time but missed the way, and her dream was fulfilled in every detail.\n\nThe preacher, Bates, also had a dream. In it he saw a young woman arrive late and sit by the door. This dream, of course, was fulfilled exactly. Bates was a Sabbathkeeper, and in three weeks Annie decided to join the Sabbathkeeping Adventists. Thenceforth she devoted her poetic talent to writing for the paper, the Review and Herald. Her first effort, “Fear Not, Little Flock,” appeared in the issue of September 16, 1851, and led to her being invited in 1852 to join the editorial staff, then at Saratoga Springs, New York. She refused at first because of her poor health and weak eyesight, but after being urged, she accepted the appointment. Her eye affliction was healed through special prayer. She did proofreading and copy editing, and became assistant editor, refusing other more remunerative positions offered to her in the teaching profession.\n\nShe contracted tuberculosis and died at Wilton, New Hampshire, on July 26, 1855, at age 27, after less than four years’ service to the church. In this brief period she wrote numerous hymns that made a permanent impression on the early believers in the Advent and brought encouragement to those who laid the foundation of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Her book Home Here, and Home in Heaven, 1855, contains 25 hymns as well as miscellaneous poems. Sixteen other poems were published after her death, in a book issued by her mother. She also wrote SDAH 441, “I Saw One Weary,” and SDAH 447, “Long Upon the Mountains.”\n\nTIS MIDNIGHT HOUR is from an anonymous American song of that title.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "The first appearance of this hymn was in Phineas A. Smith’s Second Advent Hymnbook, Rochester, New York, 1850, one of the books used by the Millerite Adventists who believed the Lord would come in October 1844. The text and tune were wedded in an SDA book by James White in Hymns and Tunes for Those Who Keep the Commandments of God and the Faith of Jesus, 1869. The Seventh-day Adventists and the Advent Christian Church seem to be the only denominations that continued to use the hymn after 1844. However, Ellen Jane Lorenz, noted author and researcher in hymnology, found the tune in 17 early American tunebooks. In most of them S. Hibbard, or variant spellings of that name, was given as composer. A variety of hymn texts was used, including “On Jordan’s Stormy Banks,” “O for a Thousand Tongues,” “O for a Heart to Praise My God,” “There Is a Land of Pure Delight,” and “When I Can Read My Title Clear.” The book Tribute of Praise bore a footnote: “Not suited for congregational use.” Sacred Lute referred to the tune as “Old Folk’s Tune.” At any rate, the tune was very popular in mid-eighteenth century. We have found no information about Bessie Doolittle or S. Hibbard.\n\nThe hymn is an expression of the hope of the Christian for eternal life in a land that is empty of earth’s sorrow. There are three other stanzas stressing the same theme of contrast between this present world and the world to come. SDAH has stanzas 1, 2, and 6 of the original.\n\nEXHORTATION is a good example of the fuguing tune so prevalent in this era, brought into American sacred music largely by the New England singing-school teacher and composer, William Billings. The fuguing tunes were greatly enjoyed for about 50 years, then they slowly went out of style, except among the Sacred Harp singers in the South, where they are alive and well and are being sung with the same fervor as when first written (see notes on BEACH SPRING, SDAH 363). For the first section of the fuguing tune, all parts usually sing together in straight four-part harmony. Then, beginning with the bass, all four parts take a turn at the melody, entering one at a time, one measure apart. After entrance, each part goes off on its own, or holds one note for a while, then all join together for harmony at the finish.\n\nIn the preface to his The Continental Harmony, 1794, Billings gives us an idea of his enthusiasm for the style: “It has more than twenty times the power of the old slow tunes, each part straining for mastery and victory. The audience is entertained and delighted, their minds surpassingly agitated and extremely fluctuated, sometimes declaring for one part and sometimes for another. Now the solemn bass demands their attention; next the manly tenor, now the volatile treble. Now here, now there, now here again. O ecstatis! Rush on, you sons of harmony.” Most of the southern tune books had from 20 to 70 songs each in this style.\n\nWhile the above description seems to indicate that these tunes were sung by a specially trained group, yet the joy of singing this one can come to any congregation that will take a little time and effort to be familiar with the parts and join in.\n\nAs the SDAH Committee was considering this hymn, it came to their attention that it is used almost like a theme song in some parts of the Caribbean area.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "The first three stanzas of this hymn, written in 1852, refer to three outstanding personalities in the early history of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The author, Annie Rebekah Smith (1828-1855; see SDAH 439), was converted by Joseph Bates (1792-1872), who is referred to in the first stanza. He was a former sea captain who gave all his wealth to the promulgation of the gospel of the imminent second advent of Christ. He always signed his letters “Yours in the blessed hope,” a constant reminder of the promise recorded in Titus 2:13, “Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.”\n\nThe second stanza is a word picture of James Springer White (1821- Facing poverty, incessant labor, fanaticism, and other hardships, his courage 1881), the virtual leader by pen and voice of the church in its early struggles, remained steadfast because of his firm hope in the second advent of Christ. He and his wife, Ellen, pioneered the development of the church against much\nopposition.\n\nThe third stanza has often been thought to refer to John Nevins Andrews (1828-1883), who became the first missionary to be sent by the church from North America to Europe. At the time of writing this hymn, however, he was not so well known. Nor could the stanza apply to Uriah Smith (see SDAH 602), Annie’s brother, for he was not then a Sabbathkeeper. Annie’s mother, Rebekah, stated that in this third stanza Annie had encapsulated her own experience, but for the sake of consistency-and perhaps to avoid any suggestion of pride or self-assertiveness, which were foreign to her charac- ter-she used masculine pronouns. Annie was quite willing for the stanza to apply to whomever it might fit. The hymn, written at Rochester, New York, first appeared on the front page of the Review and Herald of August 19, 1852, under the title “The Blessed Hope.” Annie Smith also wrote SDAH 439, “How Far From Home?” and SDAH 447, “Long Upon the Mountains.”\n\nDUANE STREET was composed in 1835 by George Coles (1792- 1858), a Methodist minister. It was named to commemorate the Duane Street church in New York, where he served.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

It was composed by John Roger Thomas in 1858 to words by George W. Elliott titled “Bonny Eloise, the Belle of Mohawk Vale,” in praise of a farmer’s daughter. It became the song of the year and later was pressed into service with sacred words, first appearing in Second in 1867. Thomas was a Welshman, an opera singer, and a prolific composer Advent Hymn Book, compiled by Phineas A.

    "historicalContext": "This is amplification of the promise in Revelation 21:4, “And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.”\n\nFrederick Dan Huntington was born May 28, 1819, at Hadley, Massachusetts, and graduated from Amherst College and Harvard Divinity School. He was a Unitarian minister in Boston, 1842-1855; professor of Christian Morals, Harvard, 1855-1859; and became a bishop of the Central New York Episcopal Church in 1869, after changing his religious affiliation to that body. He was coeditor with Frederick H. Hedge of a noted Unitarian hymnbook published in 1853, Hymns for the Church of Christ. He died July 11, 1904. Huntington contributed three original hymns to that book, but they have not found use elsewhere. This one appeared in F. E. Belden’s Hymns and Tunes, 1886, and again in his Christ in Song, 1908, but it was not included in the Church Hymnal, 1941, nor has it been used in any other American hymnbooks.\n\nIn both of these books, E. W. Dunbar is given credit for the music. He seems to have flourished in the 1850s, but nothing more is known of him. In research for another hymn, the following note was found on the title page of Stoughton Collection of Church Music, 1835: “The Stoughton [Massachusetts] Musical Society, composed of members from the towns of Stoughton, Sharon, Canton, and Randolph, was instituted A. D. 1786. First President, Elijah Dunbar, Esq.” It is possible that this is the E. W. Dunbar who composed NO SORROW THERE.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

He seemed to have a premonition of his demise, for three times he makes reference to it in the words: “Short is my pilgrimage”; “Time’s.. blast soon will be overpast”; and “I soon shall rest.” There is one other stanza.\n\nTaylor was born at Ossett, near Leeds, in Yorkshire, England, on May 9, 1807, the son of a Congregational minister. He left school at 15 and worked in an office, first for a merchant, and then for a printer. However, at 18 years of age he went to Airedale Independent College to train for the Congregational ministry. On completion of his course he was appointed to a church in Sheffield in July 1830, but ill health overtook him after six months, and he was transferred to the college as tutor of classics. However, ill health continued to weaken him until death came at Bradford on March 7, 1835.\n\nThe tune OAK was composed especially for these words in 1854 by Lowell Mason (1792-1872).\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": 1707,
    "historicalContext": "One of the best-loved of the early Advent hymns, this one was No. 21 in Isaac Watts’s (1674-1748; see Biographies) Hymns and Spiritual Songs, Book I, 1707. It bore the title “A Vision of the Kingdom of Christ Among Men,” and was based on Revelation 21:1-4. In SDAH’s fourth stanza, there is an allusion to Revelation 6:10. The words of the refrain are a description of the fullness of joy to be experienced when death shall be no longer, and the partings caused by death will never more take place. They are an amplification of the last line of the third stanza; “And death itself shall die.”\n\nIn the early days of Adventism this text was sung with great enthusiasm at prayer meetings and camp meetings, using two tunes, NORTHFIELD (see SDAH 533), and NEW JERUSALEM, found in the 1971 edition of the Sacred Harp. Both tunes were written by Jeremiah Ingalls (see SDAH 533), the Vermont farmer, cooper, tavern keeper, and singing teacher who compiled Christian Harmony, 1805.\n\nHowever, the NEW JERUSALEM tune used in SDAH, attributed to Abraham D. Merrell in the 1911 Original Sacred Harp, had its origin in a popular carol of the eighteenth century in England, “The Seven Joys of Mary” (see The Oxford Book of Carols, No. 70). It was annually printed in broadsides with many different texts, some of them extending the “Joys” of Mary to 10 or 12. Bramley and Stainer printed this traditional music in 1871.\n\nTypical of the camp meeting hymn of this era is the use of a standard hymn by Isaac Watts, or some other well-known text, and then the addition of a refrain. Ellen Jane Lorenz, in her delightful study of the camp meeting hymns, Glory Hallelujah, 1978, found 47 occurrences of this refrain in the early American tune books, most often with “How pleasant thus to dwell below.” She found also that at least 13 different “mother-hymns” were used with this tune and refrain. A slightly different version of this tune is in the 1971 edition of The Sacred Harp, where it is with the text “Am I a Soldier of the Cross,” and adds the “O that will be joyful” refrain. Here the tune is titled JOYFUL, credited to Abraham D. Merrell, “a Methodist minister who preached all over New England,” and arranged by the compiler, B. F. White. Merrell was born in New Hampshire in 1796 and died in 1878.\n\nThe form of the hymn SDAH uses is taken from the Seventh-day Adventist Hymns and Tunes, 1886, where the key is A-flat and no credit is given for words; the music is arranged, presumably, by one of the two musical editors, F. E. Belden or Edwin Barnes (see SDAH 6). They placed it in a section titled Miscellaneous-Old Melodies. We don’t know what tune he used, but James White included this text in his first hymnal, a little pamphlet of 53 items titled Hymns for God’s Peculiar People That Keep the Commandments of God and the Faith of Jesus. It also found a place in several subsequent hymnals he edited and published for the young church.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

It appeared in the Review and Herald of December 9, 1851, with the heading from Ezekiel 34:12: “So will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.” Verse 6 of the same chapter speaks of the sheep being on “the mountains.” The hymn was sung at the first General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, held at Battle Creek, Michigan, on May 20, 1863. It has been in seven previous SDA hymnals, but in no others. Annie Smith also wrote SDAH 439, “How Far From Home?” and SDAH 441, “I Saw One Weary.”\n\nGREENVILLE was composed by Jean Jacques Rousseau in 1752 when he was living in Paris, writing some musical works but mainly philosophical and political articles. He was born June 28, 1712, in Geneva, the son of a watchmaker. He was apprenticed to this trade, but ran away across the border into Annecy in France. He became a Catholic and went to Paris in 1741. When his philosophical writings brought him into conflict with the religious authorities, he fled to Switzerland, then to England, but he returned to France in 1767. His philosophy was taken up by the French revolutionaries a few years after his death on July 3, 1778. The tune is in AABA form, scores 1, 2, and 4 being identical. Score 3 differs in that the movement ascends generally instead of descending, but the harmony is very simple.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "In his Spiritual Folk Songs of Early America, George Cullen Jackson says: “This is one of the best examples of the revival spiritual song. It has the John Leland words of matchless popularity in the southern song region, a refrain in clarion tones, a chorus with a rare swing, and a primeval melodic mode.”\n\nThe stanza were written in 1833 by John Leland (1754-1841), a Baptist itinerant preacher from New England who went to Virginia and preached for about 15 years, 1775-1790. As pastor of the Mount Honey Baptist Church in Culpeper County, Virginia, he was a vigorous champion of religious liberty — he influenced James Madison’s introduction of the First Amendment to the Constitution, which guarantees separation of church and state. He wrote some 20 hymns, and he did all he could to encourage the singing of hymns in all services of the church. The story is told that one cold, winter day in 1779, while waiting beside a Virginia stream to baptize five converts, he wrote a hymn for baptism, beginning,\n\nChristians, if your hearts are warm,\nIce and snow do no harm,\nIf by Jesus you are prized,\nRise, believe, and be baptized.\n\nHe later was pastor of the Baptist church in Cheshire, Massachusetts.\n\nSeveral phrases of Leland’s hymn were borrowed freely by the Negro spirituals, such as: Toy may bury me in the east, you may bury me in the west; But I’ll hear the trumpet sound in that morning.” And the words “O do not be discouraged, for Jesus is your friend” have been used in some versions of the favorite spiritual “Balm in Gilead” (see SDAH 475).\n\nThe rousing refrain and interpolations between lines of the stanza were added by F.B. White of Georgia, and printed in his The Sacred Harp. The latest edition of that book was revised in 1791, and gives the date of 1847 for the additions done by White.\n\nBenjamin Franklin White was born September 20, 1800, near Spartanburg, South Carolina. The youngest of 14 children, he was raised on a farm. He and his wife, Thurza, also had 14 children, five of whom died in infancy. In 1840 he moved to Hamilton, Georgia, where, with coeditor E.J. King, he published The Sacred Harp, 1844. (For more on this see SDAH 363, BEACH SPRING). His musical talent was considered, in his day and area to be amazing. He was able to popularize and increase the sale of the book by conducting singing schools. However, he did not use his musical talent for personal gain.\n\nPositions he held were editor of the Harris County weekly, The Organ; clerk of the Inferior Court; and mayor in 1865 of Hamilton. He organized several military companies for the Civil War, and became a major. Deeply religious, he was a member of the Missionary Baptist Church. He died in Atlanta, Georgia, December 5, 1879. In 1984 a historical marker was unveiled on the public square of Hamilton, Georgia, in honor of B.F. White. Engraved on it was a phrase from “O When Shall I See Jesus?” which was sung by the crowd. The arrangement is by Melvin West (1930 – ).\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": 1707,
    "historicalContext": "This hymn, first published in Isaac Watts’s (1674-1748; see Biographies), Hymns and Spiritual Songs, 1707, carried the heading “A Prospect of Heaven Makes Death Easy.” It is one of his earliest compositions, and in varied forms has found its way into hundreds of hymnbooks around the world. He was sitting at his window in Southampton in 1706, gazing across Southampton Water toward Netley on the opposite shore. The pleasant meadows that lay before him suggested the beauties of the heavenly land, and inspired him to write the six stanzas of this hymn, which uses the figure of the Jordan River as a symbol of death. That river must be crossed to reach the Promised Land.\n\nThe catchy, singable refrain was added much later, and undoubtedly accounts for the great popularity of this hymn. The “What! Never part again?” refrain first appeared in Musical Gems: A Collection of Hymns and Tunes Adapted to All Occasions of Social Devotion, 1849 (the same year James White published his first little hymnbook). Ellen Jane Lorenz, in Glory, Hallelujah! The Story of the Campmeeting Spiritual, tells of finding the refrain of this camp meeting song in 20 different books from 1846 to a twentieth- Salvation Army songbook, with a variety of “mother” hymns. It was sung at the popular farewell services. This practice has continued to this day in Seventh-day Adventist camp meetings and at General Conference sessions. At the 1985 General Conference session in New Orleans, it was sung with a 250-voice choir, 125-piece orchestra, and about 40,000 people participating!\n\nDonald Frederick Haynes, the arranger, used as a basis the version found in Timbrel of Zion, 1853 (see reproduction on page 446). In this case, the “mother” hymn is “Jerusalem, My Happy Home” (SDAH 420). Haynes was born April 2, 1907, in Camden, New Jersey. His father was Carlyle B. Haynes, well known as a writer and for his work in large evangelistic campaigns and pastoral and administrative assignments in North and South America. So Donald grew up closely involved with the work of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. He was educated at Greater New York Academy and Atlantic Union College, and graduated from the Theological Seminary and also from the George Peabody College for Teachers. His versatility and creativity resulted in many lines of service to the church he loved: pastor in many areas of the United States; youth work in Battle Creek; directing large choral groups; assisting with music in evangelistic meetings with John Shuler and Robert Boothby; and Bible school manager of the Bible Auditorium of the Air, New York (later to become the television ministry Faith for Today). As a result of a tragic leg amputation and later a stroke, his final years in Glendale, California, were spent as an invalid, much of the time in great pain. He died August 5, 1975.\n\nHis life was filled with music, for he was a gifted singer, composer, organist, and violinist. A number of his 200 compositions were published by G. Schirmer. He loved male-voice singing, and arranged hundreds of hymns for men’s groups. A letter from his daughter, Dona Schultz, of Glendale, California, shares this memory: “When I was only 2 years old [about 1935 or 1936], Dad and Granddad traveled to San Francisco for a General Confer- ence gathering and they sang [this hymn] antiphonally from respective balconies. One would sing, ‘What! Never part again?’ then the other would respond, ‘No, never part again.’ I have heard generations of people tell me how that was the highlight of their experience at camp meeting and/or General Conference. It seems to be one of the old legendary favorites that has weathered time.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "The first part of this hymn was the final stanza of Charles Wesley’s “Jesus, Great Shepherd of the Sheep.” As early as 1842 it had been changed to the first stanza and the refrain added. It was in eight different collections, with largely original stanzas, in 1842 and 1843. All but two of these were Millerite Adventist collections, so we can conclude that the hymn is an anonymous product of that movement that swept the northeastern United States. In one book, the Mozart Collection of Sacred Music, 1846, the text is attributed to J. N. Moffett, who is otherwise unknown.\n\nThis hymn was popular in the meetings held by Millerite preachers in the middle of the nineteenth century. It appeared in Millennial Harp, or Second Advent Hymns; Designed for Meetings on the Second Coming of Christ, by Joshua V. Himes, Boston, 1843 (see reproduction on page 449). Notice the wide range, an octave and a fourth, one melody note of which was lowered a third in the second full measure and again in the refrain, probably by F. E. Belden (see Biographies). He included it in Hymns and Tunes, 1886, in a section titled “Miscellaneous-Old Melodies.” SDAH lowered the key from G. down to F.\n\nEllen Jane Lorenz, in her Glory, Hallelujah! The Story of the Camp Meeting Spiritual, 1978, did a study of the folk hymns found in nineteenth-century American hymnals, especially the rousing spiritual songs and choruses used in the Northern camp meetings. She found this one 60 times, and said that the chorus words, “O Canaan, bright Canaan,” seldom vary, except for the alternate sweet Canaan, but a great number of different “mother hymns” are used. She defined a mother hymn as “the words of a ‘standard’ hymn in part or whole (usually set to a folk-hymn tune), to which has been attached a camp meeting chorus.”\n\nIn his Negro Slave Songs in the United States, Miles Mark Fisher quotes Frederick Douglass about the double meaning this chorus had for the slaves: “We were at times remarkably buoyant, singing hymns, and making joyous exclamations, almost as triumphant in their tone as if we had reached a land of freedom and safety. A keen observer might have detected in our repeated singing of ‘O Canaan, sweet Canaan, I am bound for the land of Canaan,’ something more than a hope of reaching heaven. We meant to reach the North, and the North was our Canaan.”\n\nThe arrangement by Melvin West (1930-; see Biographies) is based on the version found in Hymns and Tunes, 1886.\n\n(See music score in the SDAH Companion)\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Fourteen years before the Seventh-day Adventist Church was organized in 1863, James White, one of the young leaders of the young church, compiled and published a pocket-sized book of 53 hymns. It bore the long title Hymns for God’s Peculiar People That Keep the Commandments of God, and the Faith of Jesus. Only the words of the hymns, including this one, were printed, so we must assume that all of them were sung to tunes that were well known by the people. White borrowed the song from several Millerite Adventist books, one of which was Millennial Harp, by Joshua V. Himes, Boston, 1848. This text is one of many that use the crossing of the Jordan as a metaphor for crossing over into the heavenly land, based on the text “When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan” (Josh. 3:8). In some of these songs the inference is that death furnishes the instant of the crossover, but that is not according to the plain words of Scripture. On the other hand, the metaphor can apply to the Second Coming, when the redeemed cross the barrier between their long pilgrimage on earth and the heavenly Land of Promise. There they all can join in “heavenly music” with the angel choirs.\n\nThe tune HEAVENLY MUSIC first appeared in an SDA hymnbook, the 1886 Hymns and Tunes, almost exactly as it is printed in SDAH. An earlier version of this tune, titled KEDRON, is found in the early American tunebook Timbrel of Zion, published by T. K. Collins, Jr., Philadelphia, 1853. It displays this subtitle: “A Choice Collection of Psalm and Hymn Tunes, Anthems, and Chants, From the Most Distinguished European and American Authors.” It goes on to make this claim: “The whole constituting a body of church music as complete as ever issued from the press.” The tenor part is on top. The alto, melody, and bass follow on the 4 staves. Notice that the music for the third line is a duet between melody and alto. The notes have different shapes, which indicate the degree of the scale, apart from its position on the lines and spaces.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.\n\nImagine that we are about to enter our heavenly home. Not far away from us, we can hear the angels singing bidding us welcome to the City that God has built. What a great privilege will be ours to be there.

    "historicalContext": "William H. Hyde was an early Adventist (later Seventh-day Adventist) who had been influenced by a group of fanatics. He was very sick with dysentery, and the doctor had given him very little hope of recovery. James White and his friend (later his wife) Ellen Harmon visited Hyde in Maine early in 1845 and persuaded him to leave those who were teaching error and bringing disrepute on the cause. They prayed for his restoration to health, and he was immediately and permanently healed (see Life Sketches, pp. 75, 76). Later he saw Ellen Harmon in vision and also read the account of her first vision, given in December 1844 but not published until 1846. He wrote a kind of résumé of this vision in verse, which was printed in the Present Truth of November 1850, the first published poem of a Sabbathkeeping Adventist. Phrases and sentences from the vision (see Early Writings, pp. 14-20) are appended below in order to show how the author received his stimulus from Ellen White’s description of the heavenly land.\n\nStanza 1: “A glorious light-far above the dark world-on this path the Advent people were traveling- I saw most glorious houses-to be inhabited by the saints-a pure river of water.”\n\nStanza 2: “A field of tall grass-living green-it waved proudly- field full of all kinds of flowers-mountains, on which grew roses the angels struck a note higher and sung again.”\n\nStanza 3: “He gave us harps of gold and palms of victory-they were all clothed with a glorious white mantle-the gate of the city-the pearly gate- we all cried out Alleluia-the fruit of the tree of life.”\n\nStanza 4: “King Jesus-upon His head were many crowns-His eyes were as a flame of fire-in a little while-clean hands and pure hearts-and be at rest.”\n\nWhile the poem is not by any means a masterpiece, it is not surprising that the hymn was one of the favorites of Ellen White, for it reminded her of being used by God to bring visions to His people. She sang it just before her death in 1915. It was used by several of the Adventist hymnals of that time.\n\nThe tune is sometimes called WE HAVE HEARD, sometimes BET- TER LAND. Its composer is unknown and it is of very simple structure. The first, third, and seventh lines are identical, and several notes are repeated in order to accommodate in a recitative style the peculiar meter and rhythm of poem. The harmony is also elementary, with an economical use of chords, mainly tonic and subdominant.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "We are indebted to articles by Ellen Jane Lorenz Porter and Paul Hammond in the July 1984 issue of The Hymn for the story of this hymn, which has been classified as a revival spiritual and a camp meeting song. It is thought that it was a dialogue hymn, with the women the stanza-question and the men on the other side of the aisle giving the refrain-answer. The earliest appearance of the stanza text was in Hymns and Spiritual Songs for the Use of Christians, 1812. In this and other books, Caleb J. Taylor is given as author. Nothing about him is known. Then in 1822, C. C. Abbott matched the text with WARRENTON in his Young Convert’s Pocket Companion, with the refrain, “I am bound for the kingdom.” This tune SIO Don’t you see my Jesus coming and refrain were also used many times in later Southern tunebooks with the texts “Come, Thou of Fount Every Blessing” and “Whither Goest Thou, Pilgrim Stranger?” There have been a number of variants of the tune, such as are found in William Walker’s Southern Harmony, 1835, and The Sacred Harp, 1844 (see SDAH 363). The version Wayne Hooper (1920-; see Biographies) used in making his arrangement for SDAH is from Joshua V. Himes’s Millennial Harp, 1842 and 1843, where it is in three parts and repeats the refrain with an extra “O Hallelujah!” thrown in between.\n\nThis little book is most likely the one from which the Adventists sang as they were looking for the Lord to come in October 1844. The tune is vigorous and singable, and should help to recapture the spirit of the singing pioneers.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "John Greenleaf Whittier (1807-1892; see SDAH 376) wrote a long poem of 38 stanzas in 1866 entitled “Our Master,” which was published in his Tent on the Beach, and Other Poems in 1867, and also in the Boston Congregationalist in the same year. He denied being a hymn writer or having any knowledge of music, but 36 of the 38 stanzas from this poem have appeared in many hymnals. SDAH’s selection is stanzas 1, 5, and 13 to 16. Whittier also wrote SDAH 376, “All Things Are Thine,” and 480 and 481, “Dear Lord and Father.”\n\nSERENITY was composed in 1856 by William Vincent Wallace (1812-1865) and so named because it was later used for these serene, calm words. It was first composed for Wallace’s words “Ye Winds That Waft,” and the tune was arranged by Uzziah Christopher Burnap (1834-1900; see SDAH 389) for this hymn. Wallace, born in Waterford, Ireland, was an accomplished violinist who is remembered for one of his operas Maritana. He traveled the world as a concert artist.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

The hymn was printed in December 1890. Note its four aspects of dwelling, walking, talking, and working with the Lord.\n\nThe tune, called MY LORD AND I in Church Hymnal, 1941, was composed by Hubert Platt Main (1839-1925; see SDAH 36), and copy righted in 1903.

This hymn is part of the second poem, “The Story Told.” Hankey also wrote SDAH 196, “Tell Me the Old, Old Story,” which is taken from Part I of her poem. Part I consisted of eight stanzas only, of four lines each, whereas Part II had 47 stanzas of four lines each. There are five stanzas of introduction, five about the Garden of Eden, 10 on the Nativity, seven on Christ’s ministry, eight on His crucifixion, four on the Resurrection and Ascension, two on the Comforter, five as a summary, and the last one on the Second Advent. Part II begins: “You ask me for ‘The Story,'” and then lines 2 to 4 of SDAH’s first stanza follow. The rest of the hymn, and the refrain, is by another author, probably the composer of the tune.\n\nThe tune, unnamed, was composed by William Gustavus Fischer doid (1835-1912; see SDAH 307), and published in 1869 in a pamphlet Joyful Songs. It became a universal favorite, appearing in scores of later books. Fischer also composed the unnamed tunes for SDAH 307 to the words “I Am Coming to the Cross”; and for SDAH 318, “Whiter Than Snow.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Elizabeth Payson was born in Portland, Maine, on October 26, 1818. She became a schoolteacher, and married George Lewis Prentiss, a Presbyterian minister, in 1845. She wrote several articles and poems and some books. She wrote the lines of this hymn in 1856 at a time of sorrow, which culminated in the loss of her children in an epidemic. She resigned herself in her deep grief, realizing that her comfort was found in the abiding love of her Savior. One hymn that brought great consolation to her was “Nearer, My God, to Thee” (SDAH 473), and she used the same meter for the four stanzas that she wrote. She did not think it was of any great value, except to herself, and did not show it to her husband until 1869, 13 years after it was written. He thought it was worth printing; it appeared in a leaflet in that year, and then with a tune in Songs of Devotion, a collection published by W. H. Doane in 1870. The increase in love to Christ, of which each stanza speaks, suggests a progression that is implied in the words of the verse “Herein is our love made perfect” (1 John 4:17). Elizabeth Prentiss died at Dorset, Vermont, on August 13, 1878.\n\nThe tune was composed especially for these words by William Howard Doane (1832-1916;).\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "John Tauler was one of the most celebrated of the medieval mystics, and, according to Julian, one of the most famous of all German preachers. Born about 1300 at Strasbourg, he studied at the local Dominican convent for eight years, then he went to Cologne for four years of practical theology. In 1339 he was at Basel, Switzerland, in close association with a man named Heinrich and the so-called “Friends of God.” After 1346 the remainder of his life and work was at Cologne and Strasbourg. A book of his sermons was printed in Leipzig, 1498, which later was read and appreciated by John and Charles Wesley in the Holy Club at Oxford. A book of hymns attributed to Tauler was printed at Cologne, 1543, titled Werke (Works). He died at Strasbourg on June 16, 1361.\n\nEmma Frances Bevan’s father was Philip N. Shuttleworth, warden of New College, Oxford, at the time of her birth on September 25, 1827. The wife of a Lombard Street banker, she studied the German mystics and excelled at translating their hymns from the German into English. This one appeared in Songs of Eternal Life, 1858. The very next year she published another volume of hymns, Songs of Praise for Christian Pilgrims. The first time “As the bridegroom to his chosen” appeared in a hymnal was in the English School Worship, 1926, but the tune used there did not “catch on.” Bevan died at Cannes, France, on February 13, 1909.\n\nErik Routley (see SDAH 13) considered this text for a new hymnal he was compiling, and asked his friend, Peter Cutts (1937-; see Biographies) to compose one. Sitting down at the piano, Cutts did so in about 30 minutes. The result is the charming BRIDEGROOM, which seems to fit so perfectly the spirit of this poem that compares Christ to a whole spectrum of things of earthly value. The hymn with this new tune was first used in the supplement 100 Hymns for Today printed in 1969 by Hymns Ancient and Modern. Cutts is considered the leading musician in the United Reformed Church in England, and one of the most gifted contemporary composers of hymn tunes.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Timothy Dudley-Smith (1926-  is the Anglican bishop of Thetford, Norwich, England. One of several British hymn writers producing the “explosion” of hymns in contemporary language in the 1960s and 1970s, he wrote this hymn while a pastor at Bramerton, in February 1975. Poets and hymnwriters through the ages have done their best to help us understand, by the use of imagery and analogy, what Jesus to the devout Christian. In this remarkable poem, Christ means Dudley-Smith gives us 19 images of what Christ is like. In his book Lift Every Heart, Hope Publishing Company, 1984, he lists 16 Scripture references to show how nearly every line is Bible-based. Some are: “water” (John 4:14); “strength” (Ps. 19:14); “truth” (John 14:6); “peace” (Eph. 2:14); “sun” (Ps. 84:11); “freedom” (John 8:36); and “sunrise” (Mal. 4:2).\n\nOASIS is a sprightly unison melody that, in spite of the upward leap of an octave, is enjoyable to sing. While written in a fresh, contemporary idiom, it flows logically and will present no difficulty to an alert, receptive congregation. It was composed in 1979 by Thomas Brian Coleman and first appeared in Partners in Praise, a collection of hymns for All-age Family Worship, of which he was the music coeditor. It is named for the opening lines of this hymn, for which it was especially composed, as the term Oasis conjures up the image of the thirsty traveler and the relief that is his when he arrives at a desert spring and assuages his thirst. The name also suitably describes the many other similes of our Lord in the hymn, all of which speak of refreshment, relief, and joy. It will be noticed that the change of rhythm in the words of the second half of the hymn is exactly matched by the appropriate change of accent in the melody.\n\nColeman was born in Wallsend-on-Tyne (now Tyne and Wear), Northumberland, England, on April 25, 1920. He was educated at Whit- cliffe Mount Grammar School, Yorkshire. He trained for the Methodist ministry at Wesley College, Headingley, northwest Leeds, Yorkshire, and was ordained in 1949. He served in Hebden Bridge, Bath, Reading, and then from 1964 to 1973 as chaplain at the Methodist boarding school at Truro in Cornwall. From 1973 to 1979 he was the minister at the Punshon Memorial church in Bournemouth. For the next five years he was chaplain at the Methodist boarding school in Woodhouse Grove, near Bradford in York- shire; at this writing he is serving in the Truro circuit. He has written several other hymn tunes, seven of which appear in Partners in Praise and one in Hymns for Today’s Church, 1982.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "The original German hymn was by Katharina von Schlegel born October 22, 1697. She was attached to the ducal court at Cothen. The hymn first appeared in a 1752 German Songbook Neue Sammlung Geistlicher Lieder (A New Collection of Spiritual Songs). Her death date is unknown. There are five stanzas under the title “Submission;” the reference text is: “In your patience possess ye your souls” (Luke 21:19).\n\nJane Borthwick was born April 9, 1813, the daughter of an insurance executive in Edinburgh, Scotland. While on a visit to Switzerland, she developed a keen interest in translating German hymns into English. Her sister, Sarah Borthwick Findlater, joined her in this work, and together they translated 122 hymns, which were published under the general title Hymns From the Land of Luther, 1854-1862. Sixty-one of these were by Jane; this one appeared in the second series, 1855. She died September 7, 1897, at Edinburgh. She also wrote SDAH 357, “Come, Labor On.”\n\nThe tune FINLANDIA is an arrangement of a melody from the tone poem of the same name composed in 1899 by Jean Sibelius, who has been considered the national composer of Finland. It was first used as a hymn tune in Scotland’s Presbyterian The Church Hymnary, 1927, and came into American use six years later in The Hymnal of the Presbyterian Church, U.S.A.\n\nJohan Julius Christian Sibelius was born at Tavastehus, Finland, December 8, 1865. He adopted Jean, the French form of his first name, from the name of his uncle, and used it all his life. In spite of his obvious musical talent, he received a classical education and studied law at Helsingfors University. But the call of music was too strong; he studied at the conservatory for three years, then in Berlin and Vienna until 1891, returning to Finland to compose and teach at the conservatory. His status as a national composer was recognized in 1897 when Finland awarded him a grant for life, which allowed him to retire and devote himself to writing at his home at Jarvenpaa. His catalog of works includes one opera; choral works with orchestra; seven symphonies and other orchestral works; chamber music; music for violin, piano, cello, and organ; and a large volume of solo song When he was awarded the D.Mus. at Yale University, June 17, 1914, the citation read: “What Wagner did for the ancient German legends, Dr. Sibelius has, in his own magnificent way, done for the Finnish myths in Finland’s national epos.” He died at his home on September 20, 1957.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Mrs. Joseph Fairchild Knapp (1839-1909; see SDAH 332) composed a hymn tune in 1873. Visiting Frances Jane Crosby (1820-1915), she played the tune for her. Finding that it pleased the blind author very much indeed, Mrs. Knapp asked her to write some words for it. She played it over the second time and noticed that Fanny Crosby was kneeling in prayer. After the third playing, Fanny began dictating rapidly the words of the hymn that we now have. The hymn is based on John 3:2, “Beloved, now are we the sons of God,” as is evident in the words “heir of salvation.”\n\n“Blessed Assurance” appeared first in Gems of Praise, 1873, a collection by John Robson Sweeney, with the tune named ASSURANCE, because of its association with the words. Mrs. Knapp also composed the tune for SDAH 332, sometimes called CLEANSING WAVE.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "Edward Henry Bickersteth was staying in Harrogate, Yorkshire, in 1875, and heard a sermon based on the words “Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace” (Isa. 26:3). That same afternoon he visited a dying relative and cheered his feelings of despondency by reminding him of this verse of Scripture. Within a few minutes he had composed the hymn of seven stanzas, each consisting of a question and answer, making it an excellent hymn for antiphonal singing.\n\nIt was the custom for each member of his family to repeat a hymn at tea time on Sundays, and he read this newly written one as his contribution. It received wide circulation through the years. An invalid wrote to the author, pointing out that sickness was not mentioned as one of the disturbing experiences of life. Thereupon Bickersteth wrote the following additional couplet, but did not include it officially as part of the hymn:\n\nPeace, perfect peace-mid suffering’s sharpest throes? The sympathy of Jesus breathes repose.\n\nBickersteth was born in Islington, north London, on January 25, 1825, and educated at Cambridge. He gained his B.A. in 1847 and M.A. in 1850. He was ordained in the Anglican Church in 1848 and appointed as curate in the village of Banningham, north of Norwich in Norfolk, then to Christ Church in Tunbridge Wells in Kent. Next he was rector in Hinton Martell, a small town north of Poole in Dorset. From 1855 to 1885 he was vicar of Christ Church, Hampstead, London, then dean of Gloucester, and finally bishop of Exeter. He died on May 16, 1906, in Westbourne Terrace, Paddington, London. Bickersteth wrote a commentary on the New Testa- ment, and many sermons and poems. He also edited hymnals, in particular Psalms and Hymns, 1858, and the Hymnal Companion, 1876.\n\nPAX TECUM (Peace Be With Thee) was composed especially for these words, by George Thomas Caldbeck when he was a student at Islington Theological College, London. Later he became a seller of tracts and text-cards. When arrested for not having a license to sell, he was dismissed by the magistrate without penalty when it was learned that he had composed this tune. Caldbeck, an Irishman, was born in 1852 in Waterford and died at Epsom in Surrey on January 29, 1918. Harmonization was supplied in 1877 by Charles John Vincent. He was born at Houghton-le-Spring in County Durham, England, on September 19, 1852, and became an organ builder and piano manufacturer. He was also a Doctor of Music, a noted composer and organist, and an examiner in music for the Trinity College of Music, London. He died at Monte Carlo, Monaco, on February 23, 1934.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "author": "Isaac Watts",
    "authorBirthDeath": "1674–1748",
    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": 1707,
    "historicalContext": "Under the title “The Hopes of Heaven Our Support Under Trials on Earth,” this hymn by Isaac Watts (1674-1748; see Biographies) was included in his Hymns and Spiritual Songs, 1707. In the second phrase of stanza two, Watts’s original was “And hellish darts be hurled.” It expands the promise of Jesus to His disciples when He said, “In my Father’s house are many mansions” (John 14:2).\n\nIn Watts’s day there were no repeats, but the hymn was sung to an ordinary common meter tune of four lines.\n\nThe tune name PISGAH comes from the name of a mountain near Dead Sea, where Moses was given a vision of the Promised Land. The tune was one of the most popular camp meeting melodies used in the early nineteenth century, and was sung with at least 10 different hymn texts. In this case, an extension by repetition of the text makes a sort of refrain. The melody is mostly pentatonic (five tones that can be played on the black notes of the piano). It “feels” like a folk song, and its spritely movement has led some to of the finest examples of the style.” Its composer is still a mystery. Kentucky conjecture that it came from a secular dance tune. Erik Routley calls it “one Harmony, 1816, and Allen D. Carden’s Missouri Harmony, 1820, attributed it to J. C. Lowry, about whom nothing is known. In 1819, Tennessee Harmony gave credit for it to an Alexander Johnson. It was picked up and used over and over in these oblong Southern tune books, includ- ing The Sacred Harp, 1844, where credit is given to J. C. Lowry, 1820. A note in that “an out- book says that he was standing musician of his day and wrote a great deal of sacred music.” The compiler of the Social Harp, 1855, says it was written by J. A. and J. F. Wade.\n\nIn England and Scotland the tune is known as COVENANTERS. The arrangement is by Wayne Hooper (1920-;).\n\nWilliam A. Spicer, president of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists from 1922 to 1930, tells this story in his book Pioneer Days of the Advent Message: “I remember well, as a boy, sitting in our church waiting for the preacher. Our backs were to the street door, through which the minister would enter. Then suddenly the silence would be broken by a sweetly musical and strong, sure voice, singing a familiar hymn. I can see the singer now, James White, silvery-haired, coming down the aisle, beating time on his Bible, and singing-\n\nWhen I can read my title clear\nTo mansions in the skies,\nI’ll bid farewell to every fear,\nWipe my weeping eyes.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "In the manuscripts of Horatius Bonar (1808-1889; see SDAH 79), this hymn followed the one entitled “The Church Has Waited Long” SDAH 217), the latter being printed in 1845. Bonar’s son, H. N. Bonar, thinks that the original was written about 1843, when the author was ministering at Kelso, but it was not published until 1846 in his Hymns Original and Selected. It had three stanzas of 8 lines each, and in Bonar’s Hymns of Faith and Hope, 1857, it was entitled “The Voice From Galilee,” with the text “Of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace” (John 1:16).\n\nNote that each stanza is divided into two parts, first the invitation of Jesus, and second the response. Three metaphors are used, the Saviour being likened to a resting place, a well of water, and a light; He can respectively answer the needs of the weary, the thirsty, and the benighted pilgrim. Bonar also wrote SDAH 79, “O Love of God”; SDAH 217, “The Church Has Waited Long”; and SDAH 298, “I Lay My Sins on Jesus.”\n\nKINGSFOLD, named after a village north of Horsham in Sussex, was arranged by Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872-1958; see Biographies) for the English Hymnal, 1906. It is a country folk song that he heard in this village, although it is known in Ireland and sung to the words “The Star of the County Down.” It was first published in Lucy Broadwood’s English County Songs, 1893. It is a fitting melody to the words, for halfway through, the three introductory notes rise instead of fall, matching the mood of the words, which also change at that point from the weary, thirsty, benighted one, to the glad, revived, enlightened pilgrim. KINGSFOLD is also used for SDAH 144, “O Sing a Song of Bethlehem.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

Deeply devotional meetings had been conducted in the tent, and he remained seated there, jotting down the thoughts that had been passing through his mind. Still lost in meditation, he got up and went out, unwittingly dropping the paper on which he had just written these words. An hour later, the song leader, W. George Cooper (1840-1927), came into the tent, found these stanzas, made some alterations, and completed the hymn. Then he sat down at the organ and composed this tune for the words.\n\nThe word peace occurs seven times in the hymn, and recalls the Savior’s promise to His disciples at a time of great stress: “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you…. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid” (John 14:27).\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "Brian Wren (1936-;) has given us here a unique hymn, titled “A Song of Love and Living,” for the celebration of the many experiences of life, some of which have never been sung about in hymns. The second stanza asks us to rejoice in the middle of “hardship, grief or disillusion,” pointing out that all is well if we have the love and comfort of someone. In the third, we celebrate the love that pervades our whole lifespan – from the tender moments of courtship through to old age! Stanza 4 is drawn from 1 Corinthians 13, and the final stanza sums it all up by singing about the element that surrounds everyone, the love of Christ, “that loving, living Man!” Wren says he wrote the hymn in 1970 especially for a youth service “to which no young people came!”\n\nThe first few notes of the tune LITHEROP by Peter Cutts (1937-; see Biographies) are very similar to the Scottish folk song “Comin’ Thro’ the Rye.” But from there it goes its own creative way, giving us a melody that is rather challenging with its octave leaps, and introducing rests on a couple of down beats.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Hattie Eugenia Peck Buell had attended the Methodist Episcopal Church at Thousand Island Park, New York, about 1876. While walking home, she was meditating on the joy of being a child of the King of kings. On reaching home, she sat down and wrote the words of this gospel song, not really intending them as a hymn. She sent the words as a poem to the Northern Christian Advocate in Syracuse, New York, and it was printed in the issue of February 1, 1877.\n\nHattie was born on November 2, 1834, at Cazenovia, New York. She lived in Manlius, New York, until 1898, and then moved to Washington, D.C., where she died on February 6, 1910.\n\nThe poem was seen in the magazine by John B. Sumner, and he composed the tune in the autumm of 1878 without Buell’s knowledge. A few months later she heard the song sung by a soloist in the Manluis Methodist Church! Buell’s original words were “I’m the child of a King,” but the first publishers took the liberty of interchanging the two words to make it read “I’m a child of the King.” Their basis for doing this was that the author was but one of a huge family whose head was a unique King!\n\nThe tune is sometimes called BINGHAMPTON after the town where the composer was then living. Sumner was born on March 25, 1838, at Lime Hill, Pennsylvania; he died at Binghampton, New York, on May 9, 1918. He trained for the ministry of the Methodist Episcopal Church and pastored churches in the Wyoming Conference. He conducted singing schools, wrote several hymn tunes, and was a tenor singer in the Wyoming Conference Trio, often singing at the Chautauqua meetings.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Professor Anthony Johnson Showalter returned one night to his temporary lodging place in Hartselle, Alabama, to find two letters awaiting him, both from former pupils of his in South Carolina. Each letter stated that the writer had lost his wife, and strangely enough, the women had died on the same day. In an effort to sympathize with and console his friends, Showalter turned to the Old Testament and referred to the comforting message of Moses to the children of Israel, “The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms” (Deut. 33:27). Having finished his two letters of reply, he began to think of others who might be troubled, so he wrote the words and music of the refrain of this song on this night in 1887, and sent them to the prolific hymn writer Elisha Albright Hoffman (1839-1929; see Biographies), of Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Hoffman wrote three stanzas and sent them back to Showalter, who then set them to music. This gospel song was first printed in The Glad Evangel for Revival, Camp, and Evangelistic Meetings, published in 1887 by Showalter and two others.\n\nShowalter was born in Rockingham County, Virginia, on May 1, 1858. He taught singing, and worked in the office of a music company in Georgia. Then he founded his own company and published about 60 songbooks, and edited the monthly journal of his company, The Music Teacher. He had studied under George F. Root (see SDAH 88) and others in Chicago, and also spent a year overseas, 1895-1896, in France, England, and Germany. He conducted many singing schools in rural districts in the Southern states, was an elder in the Presbyterian Church, and music director in Dalton, Georgia. He died on September 16, 1924, at Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "AIthough Eliza Edmunds Hewitt (1851-1920; see Biographies) was afflicted with spinal trouble, this hymn that she wrote betrays no suggestion of pain or complaint. It illustrates the change in outlook caused by the knowledge of the Lord Jesus: “For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ” (2 Cor. 4:6). The hymn tells of only joyous things, sunshine, music, springtime, gladness, all of which come because of a satisfying experience of the presence of Jesus Christ in the life.\n\nThe tune, unnamed, was composed in 1883 by John Robson Sweney (1837-1899), who was a former chorister in Eliza Hewitt’s church.\n\nThe occasion that inspired the hymn was the end of a long convalescence when Hewitt took a short walk outdoors. She had been hit by a slate thrown by a pupil, and for six months her back had been in a heavy plaster cast. But this morning the sound and sights of springtime, the birds, the flowers, the warmth of the sun, caused her heart to overflow with gladness as she realized the good things that even in this life the Lord has in store for those who trust Him.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Ira D. Sankey (1840-1908; see SDAH 208) tells this story in his book, My Life and the Story of the Gospel Hymns: “In the year 1901 Mr. Eben Rexford [1848-1916; see SDAH 366], editor of the Ladies’ Home Journal landscape and gardening department, wrote me, asking a donation of 50 copies of Gospel Hymns for a poor church, saying he would give me 20 new hymns in exchange. I sent the books and received the hymns, among which I found ‘A Song of Heaven and Homeland,’ which I soon set to music, and which I consider to be one of my best compositions.” Rexford also wrote SDAH 366, “O Where Are the Reapers?”\n\nThis haunting gospel song has made its way into very few hymnbooks, but became a favorite in the 1940s. George W. Greer’s arrangement, sung in the early 1950s by his Pacific Union College a cappella choir on the Voice of Prophecy radiobroadcast, was so o appealing that soon other choirs were singing it all over the country. It was published in the Voice of Prophecy Song Book, 1953, and was sung by Del Delker, contralto soloist, the King’s Heralds, and The Hymnsingers on the radio program.\n\nIn his book, Sacred Songs and Solos, published by Marshall, Morgan & Scott, London, Sankey printed this line from Revelation 14:3 at the head of the song: “And they sung as it were a new song before the throne.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Sarah Fuller Flower Adams was a member of a Unitarian congregation in Finsbury, north London. Her minister, the Reverend W. J. Fox, was compiling a collection of hymns for his church members and requested Adams to contribute some of her poems. This hymn was one of 13 that finally appeared in his Hymns and Anthems, 1841. SDAH has her original five stanzas, although the hymn has undergone many changes, mainly because of the fact that as a Unitarian the author did not mention the name of Christ in the hymn. However, she does refer to the cross in the first stanza, and after all, is simply paraphrasing the story of Jacob and his flight from home and his encounter with God. It is said that the title of the hymn, “Nearer to Thee,” was inspired by the story of a Christian martyr who was being mocked by a Roman soldier nailing the sufferer to a cross. “We will lift you a little nearer to your God,” he jeered, only to receive the reply “You are raising me nearer than you think.”\n\nSarah Flower was born in Harlow, Essex, on February 22, 1805, and married William B. Adams in 1834. She also wrote several other hymns for children and a dramatic poem about a Christian martyr. She died at St. Martin in the Fields, London, on August 14, 1848.\n\nBETHANY was composed in 1856 specifically for these words by Lowell Mason (1792-1872; see Biographies). One night he lay awake, and the melody came to him in the darkness; it was written down and harmonized the next morning. It greatly popularized the hymn, but one wonders why Mason did not name the tune BETHEL, after Jacob’s example, which means “House of God” and is actually mentioned in the fourth stanza.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

With her sister she formed a Baptist church in her hometown but married and moved to New York City. Unfortunately she was a bedridden invalid for many years, but she took great comfort, as expressed in this hymn, in the glorious hope held out to those who trust in Jesus. Her own home was made a strong center of Christian influence and a rendezvous for Christian workers. She died on June 22, 1874, in New York City.\n\nBaxter wrote a book of devotional poems and other gospel songs besides this one that she wrote in 1870. In it she describes her own personal experience, for in order to strengthen herself in her struggle against the pain and agony of her invalidism, she uttered the name of Jesus her Saviour as a defense against discouragement.\n\nThe tune, sometimes called PRECIOUS NAME, was composed especially for the words and appeared in Pure Gold, edited in 1871 by William Howard Doane and Robert Lowry.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "This beloved Negro spiritual is based on Jeremiah 8:22, “Is there no This balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?”\n\nWe could give no more beautiful analysis of this song of hope than the following by Howard Thurman from his 1945 book Deep River, Reflections on the Religious Insight of Certain of the Negro Spirituals: “The peculiar genius of the Negro slave is revealed here in much of its structural splendor. The setting is the book of Jeremiah. The prophet has come to a ‘Dead Sea’ place in his life. Not only is he discouraged over the external events in the life of Israel, but he is also spiritually depressed and tortured. As a wounded animal he cried out, ‘Is there no balm in Gilead? Is no physician there?’ It is not a question of fact that he is raising-it is not a question directed to any particular person to answer. It is not addressed either to God or to Israel, but rather it is a question raised by Jeremiah’s entire life. He is searching his own soul. He is stripped to the literal substance of himself, and is turned back on himself for an answer. Jeremiah is saying actually, ‘There must be a balm in Gilead; it cannot be that there is no balm in Gilead.’ The relentless winnowing of his own bitter experience has laid bare his soul to the end that he is brought face to face with the very ground and core of his own faith.\n\n“The slave caught the mood of this spiritual dilemma, and with it did an amazing thing. He straightened the question mark in Jeremiah’s sentence into an exclamation point: ‘There is a balm in Gilead!’ Here is a note of creative triumph. The melody itself is most suggestive. It hovers around the basic scale without any straying far afield. Only in one place is there a sharp lifting of the tonal eyebrow-a suggestion of escape; and then the melody swings back to work out its destiny within the zones of melodic agreement. The basic insight here is one of optimism- -an optimism that grows out of the pessimism of life and transcends it. It is an optimism that uses the pessimism of life as raw material out of which it creates its own strength.”\n\nIn his White and Negro Spirituals, George Pullen Jackson calls to our attention that both Charles Wesley and John Newton used the phrase “sin-sick soul.” The Newton words are:\n\nHow lost was my condition\nTill Jesus made me whole,\nThere is but one Physician\nCan cure a sin-sick soul.\n\nThe well-known refrain of this spiritual was sung in revival meetings and was published in upstate New York in The Revivalist, 1868.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

After high school he did a five-year apprenticeship and study in the field of electrical engineering, but at age 15 he had become a dedicated Christian and involved himself in soul-winning work. Study at the Evangelical Baptist Fellowship Bible College prepared him for the ministry. His career includes assistant pastor of the Seaman’s Chapel, Glasgow, Scotland; pastor of the Tent Hall (a D. L. Moody Memorial Evangelistic Center), Glasgow, where he conducted year-round evangelistic work; pastor of Inverness and New Prestwick Baptist churches; leader of the Carrubbers Close Mission, Edinburgh, Scotland; and finally, senior pastor of Willowdale Baptist Church, Toronto, Canada. In 1983 he was elected national president of the Fellowship of Evangelical Baptist Churches in Canada. Self-taught on piano and organ, he has written more than 100 songs and choruses for use in his ministry. Two books of his work have been published, Burdens Are Lifted at Calvary,1962; and New Sacred Songs for the ’80s, John M. Moore Music, Inc., 1981. He was awarded the honorary Doctor of Divinity from Northwest Baptist Theological College, Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1972.

    "historicalContext": "The words of this hymn were written by Thomas Moore (1779-1852; see SDAH 58) in 1816 to fit a German air that appealed to him, and they give comfort to sorrowing ones. The original words of the second line of the first stanza were “Come, at the shrine of God, fervently kneel” but they were changed in 1831 by Thomas Hastings (1784-1872; see SDAH 300) to the present version, which employs “mercy seat” instead. The word shrine connotes Roman Catholic associations and forms of worship, with which Moore was familiar. Hastings also substituted his own third stanza for Moore’s original.\n\nThe tune CONSOLATOR, in contradistinction to SDAH 498, CONSOLATION, is a German melody harmonized in 1792 by Samuel Webbe, who was born in London in 1740. At the age of 11 he was apprenticed to a cabinetmaker, but was more interested in the study of modern languages. In order to support himself, he worked as a copier of music, and this influenced him to take up a musical career. He had music lessons from the organist at the chapel of the Bavarian Embassy in 1776. He was also organist at the chapels of the Portuguese and Sardinian embassies in London. A Roman Catholic, he composed a considerable amount of music for the services in these chapels, as well as catches and glees. He edited An Essay on the Church Plain Chant, 1782, a collection for use in the Roman Catholic chapels in London, and with his son prepared A Collection of Motets and Antiphones, 1792. He died in London, on May 25, 1816.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "historicalContext": "William Walford, in or about the year 1842, when his sight was failing, recited this poem to his acquaintance Thomas Salmon, who was a Congregational minister at Coleshill, Warwickshire, from 1838 to 1842. The latter wrote it down and took it across the Atlantic, where it was published in the New York Observer on September 13, 1845.\n\nWalford was born on January 9, 1772, at Bath, Somerset. He moved to London with his parents when he was 5 years old. After three or four years his father died, and the family moved to Nantwich in Cheshire. While still a child, he wanted to be a clergyman, but when he was 12 he moved to Birmingham and was apprenticed for seven years to an engraver. He was confirmed in the Anglican Church but occasionally attended a Baptist church, where the minister fanned his early desire to become a minister. An Anglican minister offered Walford the finances to train at a university to be an Anglican minister, but he had scruples about the Book of Common Prayer that was obligatory for Church of England ministers to follow. He joined the Congregational church in Carr’s Lane, Birmingham, and in 1793 embarked on a six-year ministerial course at the Congregational College in Homerton, London, which enrolled about 20 students. He was appointed to the parish at Stowmarket in Suffolk when he was 24, even though he had not completed the full six years of the course. He moved to Yarmouth in Norfolk, where the congregation was more numerous and more affluent and were therefore able to pay a higher stipend, which enabled him to marry. He was ordained in 1800, although he objected to the use of this word for his church, and indeed for other Christian communions too. His health was not good, so after almost\n\n14 years at Yarmouth he was appointed as tutor of classics, i.e., Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, at Homerton College. The change of occupation helped somewhat in his continual headaches, but the loss of his daughter at the 17 in an accident caused him to request a transfer to pastoral work once more. After a break of a few years at Hackney, he moved to Uxbridge in Middlesex in 1838, but in 1847 he finally retired. He gave considerable help in the establishment of the New College, which replaced Homerton. He died on June 22, 1850, at Uxbridge.\n\nSWEET HOUR was composed especially for these words by William Batchelder Bradbury (1816-1868; see Biographies), and obviously takes its name from the words that open and close every stanza. It was composed in 1859 and appears in The Golden Chain, 1861, which was compiled by Bradbury.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "yearWritten": 1872,
    "historicalContext": "After reading the Sama-Veda, one of the sacred books of the Hindus, John Greenleaf Whittier (1807-1892; see SDAH 376), the Quaker poet, wrote a long religious poem in 1872 entitled “The Brewing of Soma.” Underneath the title he wrote, “These libations mixed with milk have been prepared for Indra: offer Soma to the drinker of Soma- Vashista, translated by Max Müller.” Soma was an intoxicating drink made from honey and milky sap, brewed by the ancient priests and alleged to be the drink of the gods. The pagan Indians drank to forget their cares and “From tent to tent / The Soma’s sacred madness went, / A storm of drunken joy.” These external forms of hectic excitement were quite foreign to Whittier’s Quaker temperament; he refers to the excitement and excessively fervent emotional scenes in some Christian revival services and camp meetings, of which he wrote a journalistic account. These, he says, are just as pagan as the Indians who aim for union with their gods:\n\nIn sensual transports wild as vain\nWe brew in many a Christian fane\nThe heathen Soma still!\n\nAfter this stanza follow the words of the SDAH hymn, which consists of stanzas 12, 13, 14, 16, and 17. The long poem appeared first in the April 1872 issue of the Atlantic Monthly.\n\nThe poem as a whole pleads for the quiet, inward spiritual communion of the soul with God, an experience so well known to Quakers, in preference to an outward excitable, highly charged emotional relationship. The last words of the poem draw upon a biblical illustration to emphasize the point, although the still, small voice that Elijah heard came after, not through, the tempestuous manifestations, as recorded in 1 Kings 19:11, 12: “the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake: and after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.” Whittier also wrote SDAH 376, “All Things Are Thine,” and SDAH 455, “Immortal Love.”\n\nCharles H. H. Parry (1848-1918; see SDAH 20) wrote the tune REPTON in scene ii of his oratorio Judith, where it is sung as a duet between Meshollemeth and a child, with the words “Long since in Egypt’s plenteous land.” It was first used as a hymn tune with Whittier’s poem in the Repton School Hymn Book (hence the tune name), 1924, and has since been included in many hymnals. H. A. Chambers composed an anthem in 1941, using REPTON and Whittier’s words, published by Novello, No. 29024708.\n\nParry also composed SDAH 20, LAUDATE DOMINUM; SDAH 80, JERUSALEM; and SDAH 636, RUSTINGTON.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Annie Sherwood Hawks was a member of a Baptist church in Brooklyn, New York, during the pastorate of Robert Lowry (1826-1899; see Biographies). He encouraged her to write hymns, and this-one of her almost 400 Sunday school songs-was written in June, 1872, especially for his collection of original songs for the Baptist Sunday School Association. There was a fifth stanza:\n\nI need Thee every hour,\nmost Most Holy One.\nO make me Thine indeed,\nThou blessed Son.\n\nThe words came to her in an atmosphere of love and joy while she was engaged in routine household duties. She experienced a sense of nearness to God and wondered how one could live without Him, either in joy or in pain. Then the title “I Need Thee Every Hour” flashed into her mind. Lowry added the words of the refrain and composed the tune. The hymn was printed in leaflet form and sung at the National Convention of Sunday Schools at Cincinnati, Ohio, in November 1872. It then appeared in Lowry’s Royal Diadem, 1873. The emphasis on “every hour” led Major D. W. Whittle to write SDAH 507, “Moment by Moment.”\n\nAnnie S. Hawks was born on May 28, 1835, in Hoosick, New York, and died in Bennington, Vermont, on January 3, 1918. She wrote some 400 hymns, but this is the only one currently in use.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

Whitfield also wrote SDAH 248, “O, How I Love Jesus.”\n\nScripture allusions are: “Unto you therefore which believe He is precious” (1 Peter 2:7). “They were strangers and pilgrims on the earth” (Heb. 11:13). “I will love thee, O Lord, my strength” (Ps. 18:1). “The Lord was my stay” (verse 18). “Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you” (1 Peter 5:7). “Behold the Lamb of God” (John 1:29). “One sat on the throne... And there was a rainbow round about the throne” (Rev. 4:2, 3). “And they shall see His face” (Rev. 22:4).\n\nRUTHERFORD, named after a famous Scottish preacher, Samuel Rutherford (1600-1661), was composed in 1834 by Chretien D’Urhan for a French hymn. He was born in Aix-la-Chapelle on February 16, 1790. He became a violin and viola player, and in 1831 concertmaster at the Opera Francaise, holding that position 30 years. He was an ascetic, eating only one meal a day, often of only bread and radishes. He died at Bellville, Paris, on November 2, 1845.\n\nThe tune was arranged by Edward Francis Rimbault, who was born in Soho, London on June 13, 1816. He was organist at several London churches and a noted musicologist. He edited and published music of all kinds. One of the founders of the Music Antiquarian Society in 1840, he took a particular interest in editing old church music. Honorary degrees were conferred on him by Harvard, Stockholm, and Göttingen. He died in St. Pancras, London on September 26, 1876.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "Some people have objected that this hymn is nothing but a sentimental nature hymn with no religious theme. However, the circumstances of its writing show clearly that it was inspired by the incident of Mary Magdalene meeting Jesus, whom she suddenly recognized in the Garden of Gethsemane on the morning of the Resurrection. In March 1912, C. Austin Miles was sitting in the darkroom, where he kept his photographic equipment and, incidentally, his organ. As he took his Bible it fell open at his favorite chapter, John 20, which he reread. Then, gazing at the light-blue wall opposite him, he seemed to see the story enacted before his mind’s eye. There were Peter and John meeting Mary Magdalene at the tomb. Finding it empty, the two men left. Mary, alone, talked with “the gardener,” who then revealed Himself to her as the risen Lord. Austin Miles came to himself with his muscles tense. Gripping his Bible and under the inspiration of his vision, he wrote the poem as quickly as he could.\n\nIn the evening of the same day he composed the tune for the words, and published the hymn in The Gospel Message, No. 2, in 1912.\n\nMiles was born at Lakehurst, New Jersey, on January 7, 1868; he was educated at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and the University of Pennsylvania. He practiced pharmacy for several years, but having written a gospel song that was favorably accepted, he was encouraged to write more. In 1898 he left pharmacy and worked full time for the Hall-Mack Publishing Company in Philadelphia, serving for 37 years as editor and manager. When the firm merged with Rodeheaver Company in 1935, he continued in an editorial capacity. He composed several anthems and cantatas, but he wished to be remembered as a composer of gospel songs, which he thought were of more value to the average person. He died at Pitman, New Jersey, on March 10, 1946.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

The hymn was written by Edna Dow Cheney, née Littehale (1824-1904), a social worker of Boston and Jamaica Plains, Massachusetts. She asks first for light to show the Christian pathway, then for strength to walk in this way, then for faith in God for protection along this way. The larger prayer for love proved to be one that comprehended the previous three requests.\n\nWOOLWICH, composed by Charles Edward Kettle, is named after the London district of Woolwich, where he was an organist. He also served as organist in Brighton, Sussex, and published Kettle’s Tune Book, which included chants, tunes, and pianoforte pieces. Kettle was born in Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England, on March 28, 1833, and died at Hove, adjacent to Brighton, Sussex, on March 2, 1895.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "yearWritten": 1740,
    "historicalContext": "This hymn by Charles Wesley (1707-1788; see Biographies), was first published in his Hymns and Sacred Poems, 1740, under the title “In Temptation.” Most probably it was prompted by the deep spiritual change that Wesley had undergone a year or two earlier. His brother, John, objected to the word “lover” as being too familiar for a human to apply to divinity. As a result, it was excluded from Methodist hymnbooks (but not Anglican!) even in their supposedly final edition in 1779, but after the death of the two Wesley brothers it found a place in 1800 and onward. John’s objections also applied to the very emotional and tender expressions in the hymn, though a verse in the Apocrypha says: “Lord, thou lover of souls” (Wisdom 11:26), and the Lord said through Jeremiah, “I have loved thee with an everlasting love” (Jer. 31:3). The hymn is noted for its simplicity and the abundant use of monosyllables, there being no less than 159 out of the 189 words of the hymn, and of the remaining 30 words 27 are of two syllables only.\n\nThe tune MARTYN was composed in 1834 by Simeon Butler Marsh (1798-1875) of Sherburne, New York, while riding on horseback on his circuit of singing schools. However, it was composed especially for his own hymn, “Mary at the Savior’s Tomb.” It is a very simple tune, for scores 1 and 2 are repeated in score 4. Of the 56 chords used, 37 are based on the tonic. Twelve of the remaining 19 are, as might be expected, based on the dominant. The committee cut the last two bars originally in each score, and combined the three chords involved into one bar only.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

Two of the original stanzas have been omitted.\n\nPENITENCE was composed in 1875 by Spencer Lane especially for these words, and published in Charles Hutchins’ Church Hymnal, 1879. The hymn had been chosen for the evening service at his church, St. James, Woonsocket, Rhode Island, but the tune set for the words was not to his liking, so after the morning service, while his wife was preparing the Sunday midday meal, he composed this tune, which was sung in the evening service.\n\nLane was born on April 7, 1843, at Tilton, New Hampshire. He served in the Union Army during the Civil War, then he studied at the New England Conservatory of Music and became a teacher of vocal and instrumental music. He was organist and choir director at St. James’ Episcopal Church in Woonsocket, for 13 years. He moved to Monson, Massachusetts, where he was music director for the Congregational Church. Then he moved to Richmond, Virginia, and finally to Baltimore, Maryland, where he was organist and choir director at All Saints’ Church. He died suddenly at Reedville, Virginia, on August 10, 1903.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "The he heart of this hymn is a prayer that we might be more like Jesus in our lives now, in order to fulfill the expectation expressed in 1 John 3:2: “Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.” The key as to how this can be accomplished is found in the request of the fourth stanza, based on Jesus’ prayer in John 17:21: “That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us; that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.”\n\nNo information is available about A. D. Ellington, who wrote the stanzas. Harold Miller added the refrain in 1931 when he wrote the original music, printed in the Junior Song Book (later renamed Missionary Volunteer Songs), 1931. At the heading it was dedicated “to my friend, LeRoy E. Froom” (see SDAH 690). The latter served for many years in the Ministerial Department of the General Conference. Miller’s music was a solo for low voice, with a rather sophisticated piano accompaniment that was difficult to play at sight because of many ledger lines below the staff. Wayne Hooper (1920-2017) has made this simple arrangement in four-part harmony, which preserves all the harmonic progressions of the original.\n\nHarold Amadeus Miller was born in 1891 at Tonawanda, New York. During his early childhood his parents were Seventh-day Adventists, but due to many activities occurring on Friday evenings in which their two older sons were involved, they gradually drifted away from the church. Miller’s father was a musician and piano teacher; he instructed Harold, who early showed a marked interest in and a talent for music. In fact, during his father’s absence for study in Vienna, Austria, 16-year-old Harold taught his father’s senior piano pupils.\n\nThe family moved to Syracuse, New York, to reestablish connections with the Seventh-day Adventist Church; there the Miller boys became acquainted with students from the South Lancaster Academy, Massachusetts (now Atlantic Union College). Here Harold Miller read of Mozart’s dislike for his middle name, Gottlieb, and of his decision to change it to Amadeus, which is the Latin form of the original German, meaning “God-loved.” Harold’s middle name was Gottlieb also (it came from an uncle), and he disliked it, too. He decided to follow Mozart’s lead and henceforth became H. A., instead of H. G., Miller. He was baptized at the academy and joined the church at Syracuse.\n\nMiller was invited to become head of the music department at Mount Vernon Academy, Ohio, where he remained from 1916 to 1929. Then he served as music teacher, choir leader, and music director, at Washington Missionary College, Maryland (now Columbia Union College); Southern Junior College, Tennessee (now Southern College); Union College, Nebraska; and Pacific Union College, California. His years of service at these SDA educational institutions totalled 37. His tunes, dedicated to teachers, students, and friends who were interested in his compositions, were written solely as a contribution to the work and progress of the church he loved and served.\n\nOf his more than 200 published hymns and songs, there were 10 in the 1941 Church Hymnal. But because a survey of pastors revealed that they were being used very little, all were deleted by the committee working on SDAH. The committee did decide to use this beautiful song by Professor Miller.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

He received his education at Davidson College, Mercer University, and Candler School of Theology at Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia. Ordained to the Methodist ministry in 1948, he has served pastorates in Georgia and Florida. “Fill My Cup, Lord” has been used more than any of his other works, which include “The Gospel According to You,” “Treasures in Heaven,” “Revelation,” and “God Can.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "In 1901 two nieces of Cleland Boyd McAfee, professor of systematic Theology at the Union Theological Seminary, Chicago, had died suddenly of diphtheria, but the whole family, though broken in spirit, still trusted in God. McAfee had been in the habit of writing a special hymn, both words and music, for the quarterly Communion service of the Presbyterian church of which he was pastor. The circumstances of his bereavement and of that of his elder brother, the nieces’ father, who also lived in Chicago, evoked the thought that the peace and comfort that they needed and had received was near to the heart of God. So he wrote the words of this hymn under the title “The Heart of God,” and its accompanying tune, and had his church choir rehearse it. They then went outside his brother’s home, where the family was in quarantine, and sang the hymn. They also sang it the following day for the Communion service. The hymn was preserved by another brother, also a minister, who used it in his congregation at the Presbyterian church in Berkeley, California. It first appeared in print in 1903 in The Choir Leader, the house magazine of the Lorenz Publishing Company, Dayton, Ohio.\n\nMcAfee was born on September 25, 1866, at Ashley, Missouri; he was educated at Park College, Parkville, and then at the seminary, before returning to teach at the college. He was pastor and director of the college church in 1901 at Chicago, then went to Brooklyn. In 1912 he was a professor at McCormick Theological Seminary, and from 1930 to 1936 secretary of the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions. He retired in New Hampshire, but continued to lecture, teach, preach, and write until his death at age 77. He died on February 4, 1944, at Jaffrey, New Hampshire. TOUR Since the late 1930s this hymn has served as a prayer theme on the Voice of Prophecy radiobroadcast.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "This hymn and the one at SDAH 564 come to us from a little book called Wings. A Book of Dohnavur Songs, With Music, 1960, published in London by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. Dohnavur is a village in Madras State, South India, where Amy Carmichael began a work for children. Customs that were legal then, though now outlawed, permitted orphaned children to be first adopted and then later sold for illicit purposes (presumably some kind of temple prostitution). Over the years Carmichael’s work grew to include nursing, caring for retarded children, and education. This was done under the auspices of a fellowship of workers. All work was voluntary, no appeals for funds were made, and the fellowship was interdenominational. It was in these circumstances that these special songs and hymns were written and published.\n\nAmy Beatrice Carmichael was born December 16, 1867, to Presbyterian parents in Millisle, east of Belfast, Northern Ireland; she was educated in Harrogate and Belfast. After gaining experience in evangelical mission work in the latter city and in Manchester, she responded to a call from God to serve overseas and in 1893 was sent by the leaders of the English Keswick Convention as their missionary to Japan. Returning after two years because of ill health, she set out again in 1895 for southern India, which land was to become her home for the remainder of her lifetime-56 years of unbroken service. In 1901 she was made aware of the moral danger to Indian caste children that arose from the Hindu devadasi system and the religious drama companies of that era. She opened a home for their rescue and upbringing as Christians. Under the hand of God, this work prospered until she found herself the “mother” of a large Indian family at Dohnavur. From that beginning sprang a range of evangelistic enterprises that continue to bear fruit. Amy wrote many children’s songs, devotional poems, and some 30 books. She died on January 18, 1951, in Dohnavur, where she had given most of her life in loving service for the Lord. She also wrote SDAH 564, “For Sunrise Hope and Sunset Calm.”\n\nKenneth Stuart Proctor was born in 1895 in England, and ordained in 1923 to the ministry of the Church of England at Winchester Cathedral. An amateur musician, he was passing through southern India on the way to an appointment in Rangoon in the 1920s when he was inspired by the children of Amy Carmichael’s homes at Dohnavur to compose a number of delightful tunes for their songs and for the prayers of her fellow workers. He now lives in retirement at Torquay, England.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

The contest committee awarded Tweedy the prize. The hymn is a beautiful exposition on the meaning of effectual prayer and on how to pray.\n\nHALIFAX is borrowed from the aria “Ask if yon damask rose be sweet, in Handel’s (1685-1759; see SDAH 125) oratorio Susanna, 1748. The arrangement as a hymn tune was first used in Thomas Butts’ Harmonia Sacra, published about 1756. It carried the name HALIFAX and was with the text “Indulgent Father! how divine.” The arrangement SDAH uses was made in 1941 for the Episcopal Hymnal 1940, by Winfred Douglas (1867-1944; see SDAH 72). Notice that the melody in the first four bars is copied in the next four bars, but a third higher and modulated to the relative major key.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Harriet Elizabeth Beecher Stowe, sister of the famous preacher Henry Ward Beecher, was better known in her own right as the author of Uncle Tom’s Cabin. In the summer of 1853, while she was on a visit to a friend, she often arose at 4:30 in the morning so that she could enjoy the beauty of the dawn and the early singing of the birds. The hymn, as first published in 1855 in the Plymouth Collection, edited by her brother, had six stanzas. The thought running through the whole poem is that of the psalmist: “When I awake, I am still with thee” (Ps. 139:18), and this extended to the sleep of death and the glorious awakening to eternal life in the presence of God.\n\nHarriet Beecher was born at Litchfield, Connecticut, on June 14, 1811, daughter of Lyman Beecher, who later served as president of Lane Seminary, Ohio, from 1832 to 1852. She married Calvin E. Stowe, who was professor of language and biblical literature at the seminary. She wrote Religious Poems, published in 1867. She died on July 1, 1896, at Hartford, Connecticut. A fervent abolitionist, she also wrote Dred, a Tale of a Dismal Swamp, 1856; and Lady Byron Vindicated, 1870.\n\nCONSOLATION is an arrangement from Jacob Ludwig Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy (1809-1847). It is an adaptation from his Songs Without Words, Opus 30, No. 3, and has been in use as a hymn tune since the 1860s.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Joseph Medlicott Scriven wrote these words, titled “Pray Without Ceasing,” for his mother in Ireland, with the express intention of bringing comfort to her at a time of sorrow. They were written in 1855 at Port Hope, Ontario, Canada, and never intended to be a hymn, but they were included in Horace L. Hastings’ Social Hymns, Original and Selected, 1865, credited to “Anon.” It was not generally known in his neighborhood that he was the author of the words. When questioned about it, he replied, “The Lord and I did it between us.”\n\nScriven was born on September 10, 1819, at Seapatrick, County Down, Ireland. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, but he left and joined the army. However, poor health caused him to give up this career, so he returned to the university and graduated with a B.A. Unfortunately, his anticipated bride was thrown from her horse into a river and drowned just before the wedding, and he decided to begin a new life in Canada in 1844. He became a teacher and joined the Plymouth Brethren. For the second time, when he was to be married, his fiancée died, this time from pneumonia after being baptized in an icy lake.\n\nAlthough he suffered financial loss and was subject to fits of deep depression, he was known in the township of Bewdley, near Port Hope, as a committed Christian who was always ready to help the poor widows, sick persons, and handicapped people by seeing that they had a good supply of sawed wood for their fires. One cold morning, October 10, 1886, his body was found in Rice Lake, Bewdly, Ontario. It was never determined whether this fatality was an accident or a suicide.\n\nCONVERSE commemorates the composer Charles Crozat Converse, who was born on October 7, 1832, at Warren, Massachusetts. He wrote the tune in 1868 and published the hymn in his Silver Wings, 1870. It is a typical gospel song melody with very little variation in the male parts, but quite tuneful progressions in the soprano and alto. Converse compiled and edited a number of Sunday school songbooks in association with W. B. Bradbury and Ira D. Sankey, and wrote some tunes under the pseudonym of Karl Reden. He went overseas in 1855 and studied law, philosophy, and music at Leipzig. He returned to Erie, Pennsylvania, in 1859 and engaged in a successful law practice there. He composed string quartets, cantatas, chorales, and hymn tunes. He died on October 18, 1918, at Highwood, New Jersey.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "yearWritten": 1882,
    "historicalContext": "William Dunn Longstaff, a wealthy Englishman, heard a sermon preached by a returned missionary from China, Griffith John, on the text: “Be ye holy; for I am holy” (1 Peter 1:16). The verse is a direct quotation from the Old Testament (Lev. 11:44), where it appears as a description of a future event rather than an imperative command. Longstaff was a friend of D. L. Moody and Ira D. Sankey, and when this evangelistic duo visited the northeastern part of England he showed them the poem he had written as a result of his hearing the sermon.\n\nThe poem was written in 1882 and given to Sankey, who passed it on to George Coles Stebbins (1846-1945), who laid it aside for further attention. Not until eight years later, in 1890, when Stebbins was in India, did he remember its existence. He was leading the music in an evangelistic revival meeting and the subject of holiness was mentioned. This triggered Stebbins’ memory, so he searched for the poem among his papers, found it, and set the words to this tune, HOLINESS. He sent the complete hymn to Sankey, who published it later that same year in Winnowed Songs for the Sunday School.\n\nLongstaff was born on January 28, 1822, in Sunderland, England, the son of a rich shipowner. He was a faithful steward of his riches and was known to be a most philanthropic and generous individual. He was treasurer of the Bethesda Free Chapel in Sunderland; he was a friend of Moody and Sankey, and also of William Booth, the founder of the Salvation Army. He died on April 2, 1894, in his hometown of Sunderland.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "yearWritten": 1820,
    "historicalContext": "This hymn is a selection from a 14-stanza poem written on November 25, 1820, by John Keble and published in his Christian Year Thoughts in Verse for the Sundays and Holydays Throughout the Year, 1827. It is entitled “Evening” and headed “Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent” (Luke 24:29). The opening four words of the hymn are a metaphor referring to the two preceding, but omitted, stanzas, which speak of the setting of the literal sun.\n\nJohn Keble was born at Fairford, Gloucestershire, on April 25, 1792. He was educated at home in his father’s vicarage at the village of Coln St. Aldwyn, north of Fairford. He gained a scholarship to Oxford University and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1810. He was ordained in 1815 and became curate of the two villages of East Leach and Burthorpe, near his father’s parish. He resided mainly in Oxford, however, which is about 17 miles farther east; he was appointed tutor at Oriel College, from 1818 to 1823. In 1823 he went to Southrop as curate, and in 1825 he was curate of Hursley in Hampshire, a small town near Winchester. He was appointed professor of poetry at Oxford for the years 1831 to 1841. He had left Hursley in 1828 to become provost of Oriel, but returned as vicar in 1836, remaining until failing health caused him to retire and move to Bournemouth, where he died on March 29, 1866. He is remembered for his Assize sermon in 1833, which John Newman (later cardinal) considered to be the beginning of the Oxford movement, and also for Keble College, Oxford, named after him in 1869, as well as for many other published works and sermons.\n\nHURSLEY is a tune found in the Austrian Katholisches Gesangbuch (Catholic Hymnbook) of about the year 1774, set to the words “Grosser Gott, wir loben Dich” (“Great God, we praise Thee”) (see SD SDAH 30). It closely resembles a drinking song from Mozart’s Nozze di Figaro, to such an extent that Sir Herbert S. Oakley was stimulated to compose the tune ABENDS (see SDAH 242) for “Sun of My Soul.” HURSLEY is only one of many names for this tune; it commemorates the parish where Keble served for so many years. His church was restored from funds provided by profits from the sale of his Christian Year, and Keble is buried there.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

An orchestrator, choir director, and radio and television performer, he runs composer, arranger, his own publishing and recording business. Written in 1967, this meditation song recalls Jesus’ words to His disciples in Mark 6:31, “And He said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.”\n\nCarmichael wrote this song for himself. It was at a time of tremendous pressure, with much to be done in a short time to meet a deadline. So he went to “a quiet place,” to be “refreshed from above.” Two other Carmichael in SDAH are No. 289, “The Savior Is Waiting,” and No. 671,\n“As We Come to You in Prayer.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Charles Kingsley, rector of Eversley in Hampshire, England, and well-known novelist, describes in his book Hypatia, the conflict of Christianity with paganism at Alexandria at the beginning of the fifth century. Here we meet Synesius of Cyrene (c. 375-c. 430), who was converted in 401 and appointed bishop of Ptolemais by popular vote in 409. He was a deputy from Cyrene to the court of Arcadius in Thrace in the eastern empire at a time when the Goths were threatening North Africa. He was known as a statesman and philosopher, and for the eloquent way he could express his patriotism. He wrote 10 odes, which he considered as forming one book; this hymn is the last one, entitled “Mnoeo Xriste” (Remember, O Christ).\n\nElizabeth Barrett Browning translated two of these odes and said they had a “wonderful rapture and ecstasy.” Chatfield translated all 10 of them in his Songs and Hymns of the Earliest Greek Christian Poets, 1876. “Lord Jesus, Think on Me” is more of a paraphrase than a translation. The original had five stanzas; Chatfield added four new stanzas in a later edition. The last stanza in SDAH seems to be a modification of Chatfield’s stanza 8, incorporating a typical doxology. The first line of each stanza is Nehemiah’s prayer: “Think upon me, my God” (Neh. 5:19).\n\nAllen William Chatfield was born October 2, 1808, in the vicarage (parsonage) of his father, an Anglican pastor of Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, England. Educated at Charterhouse School and Trinity College, Cambridge, he was ordained in 1832 and served until 1847 at Stotfold, Bedfordshire. From then until his death (49 years!) he was vicar of the small village of Much Marcle, Herefordshire. He is best known for his book of translations from the Greek poets mentioned above. He died on January 10, 1896.\n\nSOUTHWELL, also known as DAMON and LONDON, is named after Southwell, a cathedral city in Nottinghamshire, England. The tune is one of the earliest in short meter, or 6.6.8.6., and first appeared in William Damon’s Psalms, 1579, the full title of which was “The Psalmes of David in English meter, with Notes of foure partes set vnto them, by Gulielmo Damon, for Iohn Bull, to the vse of the godly Christians for recreating themseluse, in stede of fond and vnseemley Ballades.” Damon (1540-1591) was organist of the Chapel Royal in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nWe are told by James Lightwood in Hymn Tunes and Their Story, 1905, that Damon put together his collection of psalms for the private use of his good friend John Bull, a goldsmith who often had evening psalm-singing sessions at his home. Bull liked them so well that, without authorization, he had them published. Damon was not too happy that he did this, feeling they were not good enough; he destroyed all the copies he could find. Twelve years later Damon himself published a corrected version, which he felt was more in line with his skill as a musician. In this and some later printings, the tune was in the Dorian mode, which would make the third and fourth notes of the\ndifferent melody in our second staff C-sharp instead of C-natural, quite an effect than our modern minor scale. The melody is notable for the number of pairs of repeated notes, a total of 20 out of 26 in the complete melody, nine pairs being in succession.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "James D. Vaughan, the writer of both words and music of this song, was born December 14, 1864, on the line between Lawrence and Giles counties, Tennessee. One of six sons, he was educated in public and private schools, and a normal singing school. He and three of his brothers learned the basic “do-re-mi’s” at a singing school a few miles from their home, and at age 18 James began teaching in such a school himself. After advanced musical study, he decided in 1902 to make the writing and publishing of music his life’s work, locating in Lawrenceburg, Tennessee. His first songbook was titled Gospel Chimes. In 1911 he established the Vaughan School of Music, with students coming from far and near to study with qualified teachers. By 1939 it was the largest such school in America. Active in local politics, Vaughan was for four years mayor of Lawrenceburg, and was owner and publisher of the local News. He wrote some 500 gospel songs, including “Will the Circle Be Unbroken?” and “I Dreamed I Searched Heaven for You.” After his death in 1941, his church was renamed “James D. Vaughan Memorial Nazarene Church.”\n\nThis song was used by the King’s Heralds on the Voice of Prophecy radiobroadcast over a period of 40 years. Each time, it generated more mail than any other song, showing a deep-felt universal need to be prayed for by loved ones.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "yearWritten": 1529,
    "historicalContext": "This “battle hymn of the Reformation” was written by Martin Luther, most probably just preceding the Diet of Speyer (or Spires) on April 20, 1529. It was on that occasion that the German princes opposed the papacy’s refusal to tolerate the new doctrine of Luther. They protested, that is, spoke on behalf of, their religious rights and so earned for posterity the name of Protestant. The name now connotes an opposition to, or denial of, Roman Catholicism, but originally it had the positive meaning of manifesting firm faith in God and truth.\n\nMartin Luther was born at Eisleben, 20 miles west of Halle, now in East Germany, on November 10, 1483. He was educated in secondary schools at Eisenach and at Magdeburg. In 1501 he entered the University of Erfurt to study for the legal profession, graduating with a B.A. in 1502 and an M.A. in 1503. However, in 1505 he began another course-he entered the Augustinian monastery at Erfurt, and was ordained priest in 1507. He was appointed professor at the University of Wittenberg in 1508. A visit to Rome disturbed him as he observed the corruption in the church, and on his return he spoke out against the practice of granting indulgences. The matter came to a head when Tetzel came to Wittenberg to sell indulgences, prompting Luther to prepare his 95 theses denouncing certain corrupt practices in the church. He nailed a copy to the church door, and sent a copy to the archbishop as a basis for public debate. He was called to Rome to defend them, but the elector of Saxony and his university kept him in Germany. Luther’s treatise on The Babylonian Captivity of the Church produced a papal bull, which Luther publicly burned in 1520. For this he was excommunicated.\n\nIn 1521 he was summoned before the Diet of Worms but held fast to his convictions, accepting only evidence from the Scriptures. Returning to Wittenberg, he was “kidnapped” for his own safety by soldiers of the elector of Saxony, and was taken to the castle of Wartburg, near Eisenach, where he spent the next year. Here he began his translation of the Bible into German, and completed the New Testament in 1522. The Old Testament was published in 1534. The Reformation had begun, and Luther returned to Wittenberg in 1522. He strengthened the movement by publishing the first hymnbook in the language of his people. It had eight hymns in the first edition of 1524, and 40 in the second edition the next year. Luther married a former nun, Katherine von Bora, in 1525. In all, he wrote 37 original hymns and published nine hymnals, drawing from various sources, adapting and revising. In this way he furnished a foundation for the success of the Protestant Reformation. Luther died on February 18, 1546, while on a visit to his native Eisleben.\n\nMore than 50 translations of Luther’s hymn have been made into English, this one by Frederick Henry Hedge, which he made in 1852 for W. German Verse. Hedge was born at Cambridge, H. Furness’s Gems Massachusetts, on December 12, 1805, and was educated at Harvard and in Germany. He became a pastor of the Unitarian Church, serving first at West Cambridge from 1829 until 1835, and then transferring to Bangor, Maine. In 1850 he moved to Providence, Rhode Island, and then back to Brookline, Massachusetts, in 1856. The next year he was\nappointed professor of ecclesiastical history at Harvard, and in 1872 professor of German literature there. He made two other translations from German and wrote four original hymns. He died at Cambridge, Massachusetts, on August 21, 1890.\n\nThe tune, aptly called EIN’ FESTE BURG (A Fortified Castle), (Hymnal) of 1529, but no copy is now in existence, although the tune is in composed by Martin Luther and is known to have been in Klug’s Gesangbuch the third edition of 1535. The tune was used by Mendelssohn in the fifth movement of his Reformation Symphony, by Meyerbeer in his prelude to the opera The Huguenots, and by Wagner in his Kaisermarsch, 1871. It is the national hymn of Germany and was sung at Luther’s funeral. On his tombstone at Eisleben is carved the first line of the hymn: “Ein’ feste burg ist unser Gott” (“Our God is a strong fortress”).\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Evangelist Daniel Webster Whittle (1840-1901; see SDAH 195) was talking with his friend Henry Varley at the Chicago World’s Fair and was greatly impressed by Varley’s remark, “I do not like the hymn ‘I Need Thee Every Hour’ [SDAH 483] very well, because I need Him every moment.” This prompted a line of thought that resulted in the writing of this hymn. The expression “moment by moment” occurs once in each stanza, and three times in the refrain. Whittle brought the manuscript to Ira Sankey (1840-1908; see Biographies) saying that he would give his copyright of both words and music to him if he would print 500 copies for Whittle to distribute to his friends.\n\nThis constant care of God for His people moment by moment is mentioned in Isaiah’s parable of the vineyard: “I the Lord do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day” (Isa. 27:3). Whittle also wrote SDAH 195, “Showers of Blessing,” and SDAH 511, “I Know Whom I Have Believed.”\n\nThe tune, sometimes called MOMENT BY MOMENT, was composed by Whittle’s daughter Mary, or May, who later became the wife of Will R. Moody, son of evangelist Dwight L. Moody. In 1893 the first copyrighted leaflets were printed, and the gospel song appeared in Sankey’s Sacred Songs, 1896.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

Pounds of the Central Christian Church in Indianapolis. In her lifetime she wrote more than 400 gospel songs, nine books, and words for cantatas. She died at Hiram in 1921. This hymn was written in 1886 and published in Hymns Old and New, 1887, to the unnamed tune. Between 1910 and 1920 two other stanzas were added by Helen Cadbury Alexander (1877-?), the wife of the well-known evangelist C. M. Alexander, and daughter of the equally famous Richard Cadbury, Quaker philanthropist. She married Alexander in 1904, and after his death she married Amsji C. Dixon.\n\nThe tune, sometimes named SECURITY because of the theme of the words, was composed by Daniel Brink Towner (1850-1919; see SDAH 109). It is mostly in thirds or sixths in the upper parts and based mainly on two chords. Towner also composed SDAH 109, unnamed, and SDAH 590, sometimes called TRUST AND OBEY.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "This hymn first appeared in John Rippon’s (1751-1836) A Selection of Hymns from the Best Authors, 1787, in seven stanzas, under the title “Exceeding Great and Precious Promises.” The title is taken from 2 Peter 1:4: “Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises.” The Hymn is initialed ‘K’ which is an1822 Collection of Hymns, is credited to ‘Kn’ and is an 1835 edition as “Keen,” a gentleman about whom nothing further is known. There was an R. Keene, who was precentor of Rippon’s Baptist Church in New Park Street, London. He composed the tune GEARD, which was the first setting to the words.\n\nJohn Rippon was born on April 29, 1751, at Tiverton, Devonshire, England. He trained for the ministry at the Baptist College in Bristol and in 1773 was appointed to be the temporary pastor of the Baptist Church in Carter Lane, Tooley Street, London. The appointment however proved to be permanent, for he continued with the church as it moved to New Park Street, for a period of 63 years until his death in London on December 17, 1836.\n\nHe published, in addition to the book above mentioned, A Selection of Psalm and Hymn Tunes from the Best Authors, 1791, a popular work that went into 27 editions. He was considered to be an authority on Isaac Watts and wrote some of the hymns in his Selection, although not specifying which were of his composition. He also altered the text of some of the hymns—for example, SDAH 229, “All Hail the Power of Jesus’ Name”—and made additions to others. The Baptist College of Providence, Rhode Island, honored him in 1792 with the degree of Doctor of Divinity.\n\nFOUNDATION is an early American hymn melody in the pentatonic scale, found in Joseph Funk’s A Compilation of Genuine Church Music, 1832, and in The Sacred Harp, 1844, where it is credited to Z. chambers. It has been known as BELLEVUE, CONVENTION, and PROTECTION. Its present name shoes its association with the words “How Firm a Foundation.” Funk was born on April 6, 1778, in westernPennsylvania. He moved with his patents two years later to the Shenandoah Valley, near Harrisonburg, Virginia. He learned and taught music and conducted singing schools in Virginia, and started a monthly journal for rural music and singing schools. He also translated two Mennonite publications. Funk died in 1862. The tune was arranged for SDAH by Melvin West (1930-; see Biographies) in 1984.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "Written at Kiel, 1641, this hymn carried the heading “A Song of Comfort. God will care for and help everyone in His own time. ‘Cast thy burden upon the Lord and He shall sustain thee.’ Psalm 55:22.”\n\nGeorge Neumark had just passed through a terrible time in his life. A young student, he had been robbed by thugs and left without money and no way to earn a living. Unexpectedly, after a month he obtained a job as a tutor in the family of a judge in Kiel, “which good fortune,” he said, “coming suddenly and as if fallen from heaven, greatly rejoiced me, and on that very day I composed to the honor of my beloved Lord the hymn, well-known here and there, WER NUR DEN LIEBEN GOTT, and had certainly cause enough to thank the divine compassion for such unlooked for grace shown to me.”\n\nAfter the hymn was published in 1657 with Neumark’s melody, it become very popular in Germany, and was sung at the funeral of Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia. Catherine Winkworth (see Biographies) made two different translations from the German, this one being altered from her Chorale Book for England, 1863.\n\nWER NUR DEN LIEBEN GOTT (also known as NEUMARK) is from the first line of the original German hymn, which translated is “Who will only let the good God rule.” Neumark’s melody did not flat the sixth note of the scale, se all of his E’s were natural. Bach liked the tune and used it in his Cantatas 21, 27, 84, 88, 93, 166, 179, and 197. Organ settings of it are found in his Orgelbuchlein, in the Schubler Chorales, and is the Miscellaneous Preludes. Mendelssohn put it with the text “To Thee, O Lord, I Lift My Spirit” in his oratorio St. Paul. More than 400 texts have been sung to this tuned!\n\nGeorge Neumark was born March 16, 1621, the son of a clothier in Langensalza, Thuringia, Germany. After graduating from the gymnasium at Gotha, he was traveling with merchants toward Lubeck when the robbery occurred. Tutoring for two years, he saved enough money to go to Konigsberg University, where he studied law and poetry for five years. After several years and positions in many places, he became court poet, library and registrar to Duke Wilhelm II of Sachse-Wiemar. In 1653 he was admitted as a member of the Fruit-bearing Society, the foremost literary organization of the time, and was its secretary in 1656. The final mouths of his life were spent in total blindness, and death came July 18, 1681. He wrote some secular poetry and 34 hymns, but is chiefly remembered for this classic hymn and tune.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

Very early in life she began writing hymns, publishing the above volume of 19 at the age of 27. Later editions of the book brought the total to 39 hymns. In order to be able to read the Old Testament in the original, she diligently became a Hebrew scholar sacraments, she was baptized and joined the Church of England in 1842. Moving to Clifton in Bristol in later life, she was active in giving of her time and energy to the Discharge Prisoners’ Aid Society, herself visiting the prisoners at Bristol. She died in Bristol on May 10, 1910.\n\nThe Finnish tune NYLAND (see SDAH 67) was arranged in 1927 by David Evans (1874-1948; see Biographies), one if the most distinguished musicians in the history of Wales.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Matthaus Apelles von Lowenstern wrote a hymn of four stanzas of 4 lines each, entitled “Sapphie Ode: For spiritual and temporal peace,” in 1644. It reflects the conditions during the Thirty Years’ War, which was virtually a religious war between Catholics and Protestants and lasted from 1618 to 1648. The words are a prayer for God to send peace on earth. In 1834 the hymn was freely paraphrased, using the German text as a basis, by Philip Pusey into five stanzas of four lines each. Pusey made it refer to the Church of England, which was “enfeebled within and assailed from without, but on the verge, nevertheless, of a great awakening,” as he wrote to his more famous brother, Dr. Edward Bouverie Pusey (1800-1882). The hymn was first printed in Alexander R. Reinagle’s (see SDAH 238) Psalms and Hymn Tunes, 1840.\n\nLowenstern was born in Neustadt, Silesia, on April 20 1594. He showed musical ability early in life. In 1625 he was appointed music director and treasurer at Bernstadt, for Duke Heinrich Wenzel of Munsterberg; later he became duke’s financial secretary and adviser. Later still he served both Ferdinand II and Ferdinand III. As well as an administrator, he was musician and poet and wrote 30 original hymns with melodies of his own. He died at Breslau on April 11, 1648.\n\nPusey was born on the family estate at Pusey, a small village near Oxford on June 25, 1799; he was educated at Eton Oxford. He left the university without taking a degree, however, and traveled in Europe. In 1828 he inherited the family estate and devoted his time to agriculture and public service. He wrote extensively on agriculture and was one of the founders of the Royal Agriculture Society, being elected its first president in 1840. He was also a member of Parliament, a Fellow of the Royal Society, and one of the founders of the London Library. He died on Oxford on July 9, 1855. CLOISTERS was especially written in 1868 for these words by Joseph Barnby (1838-1896; see Biographies).\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

She was short of money at the time and needed this amount before she was able to draw money from her publishers. This experience awakened a train of thought that culminated in the writing of these words. They are a reminder that she wrote many of her hymns after a day’s jostling through the city streets, led by loving hands (she was blind) away from danger. The heading of the hymn when printed was: “So the Lord Alone Did Lead Him” (see Deut. 32:12).\n\nCrosby sent the hymn to Robert Lowry (1826-1899; see Biographies), with whom she had become acquainted some nine years earlier, and whom she often consulted regarding the phrasing of a hymn. Lowry composed the tune, which now bears his name, especially for the words. It was printed in a Sunday school collection entitled Brightest and Best, 1875, edited by Lowry and William H. Doane (1832-1915; see Biographies).\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "historicalContext": "This hymn was the first one written by Ray Palmer (1808-1887; see SDAH 242), in the year 1830. It was for his personal benefit, as an expression of his own faith. He said of the hymn, “I gave form to what I felt by writing, with little effort, the stanzas. I recollect I wrote them with very tender emotion and ended the last line with tears.” The original had four stanzas. In brief, the petition in the four stanzas ate: hear me, strengthen me, guide me save me.\n\nPalmer carried the poem about with him in his pocketbook for some time. When asked by Lowell Mason (1792-1872; see Biographies), if he had anything to contribute to a new compilation, Palmer produced the four stanzas of this hymn. Mason soon composed the tune OLIVET, which has been associated with the words ever since. In 1831 Mason published the complete hymn in Spiritual Songs for Social Worship, compiled by himself and Thomas Hastings (see SDAH 300). Time has proved true Mason’s prediction that Palmer might live long and do many good things but would best be remembered as the author of “My Faith Looks Up to Thee.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

He was such an outstanding student that the school invited him to stay and teach. He spent 18 years teaching chemistry, natural science, civil engineering, and mathematics and three years as a sheepherder in California. In 1887 he was ordained a Methodist minister, and became involved with the Holiness movement, which included camp meetings. Active with the pen, he published several novels, and works on science, mathematics, and religion. Collaborating with A. B. Simpson, in 1891 he published Hymns of Christian Life, to which he contributed 52 hymn texts, 68 tunes, and arrangements of 25 other tunes. There seemed to be no end to his quest for knowledge, for he quit the ministry, studied medicine, and became a practicing physician in Baltimore. He died at Catonsville, Maryland, August 23, 1928. It has been suggested that the marching character of this song comes from Carter’s long experience in the military academy.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "The original German hymn from which this was translated was written in 1653 and appeared in Cruger’s Praxis Pietatis Melica (The Practice of Musical Piety). It was entitled “Befiehl du deine Wege” (Commit Thy Ways), which are the first words of Psalm 37:5: “Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.” It was written by Paul Gerhardt (1607-1676; see SDAH 57), and was an acrostic, each stanza beginning with the consecutive words of the verse in Luther’s translation. That is, if the same pattern were adopted in English, stanza I would begin with “commit,” stanza 2 with “thy,” stanza 3 with “way,” and so on. Gerhardt also wrote the originals of SDAH 57, “Now All the Woods Are Sleeping,” and SDAH 156, a translation from Bernard of Clairvaux, further translated as “O Sacred Head Now Wounded.”\n\nJohn Wesley (1703-1791; see SDAH 177) translated this present hymn in two parts and entitled it “Trust in Providence.” The second part had four stanzas of eight lines each, from which our hymn has been selected and altered.\n\nST. BRIDE first appeared in William Riley’s Parochial Harmony, 1762, set to Psalm 130, with the title “St. Bridget’s Tune by Mr. Samuel Howard.” ST. BRIDE is the abridged form of Saint Bridget, the patroness of Ireland, who lived during the middle of the sixth century and was regarded by the Irish, Picts, and Scots as second only to the virgin Mary. Churches were dedicated to God and name in her memory. One of these is on the south side of Fleet Street, very near to Ludgate Circus, London. Noted for its tall steeple, it was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666 and rebuilt by Christopher Wren in 1680.\n\nNote that the tune begins in a minor key, modulates to the relative major key, then another modulation until it returns to the original key of G minor. Note also the complete descending octave in the melody of the third line and the movement in all four parts.\n\nSamuel Howard was born in 1710 in London and became a chorister in the Chapel Royal under William Croft (see SDAH 103). He was organist at St. Clement Danes Church, and then at St. Bride on Fleet Street. Cambridge University conferred on him the D. Mus. In 1769. He assisted William Boyce in compiling his book Church Music. He died July 13, 1781 or 1782.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "Edward Mote, born in London on January 21, 1797, was apprenticed to a cabinetmaker. During this period, at the age of 16, he was converted after listening to a sermon by the Reverend John Hyatt. He joined the Baptist Church two years later and lived in Southwark, south of the river Thames, and used to make a daily journey to the northern part of London to engage in his business. One day in 1834 as he went to work an idea came into his mind that he should write a hymn on the gracious experience of being a Christian. Walking up Holborn Hill, he formed the words of the refrain, evidently taking them from the last part of Jesus’ sermon on the mount, which describes two men, one who “built his house upon a rock,” and the other, “a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand.” Later the same day Mote completed four stanzas. The following Sunday he was requested by a friend to visit his dying wife. His friend’s custom for evening worship was to read the Bible and sing a hymn, but he could not find his hymnbook. Motes brought out his four stanzas and refrain and offered to sing them instead. They were greatly appreciated, which stimulated him to write two write two more stanzas. He decided to have the hymn printed and sent a copy to the Spiritual Magazine, where it was published. It was taken into hymnbooks in 1836 and 1837. Mote included it with 99 others of his compositions in his Hymns of Praise, a New Selection of Gospel Hymns, 1836, under the title “The Immutable Basis of a Sinner’s Hope.”\n\nLate in life Mote became a Baptist minister. He was appointed to Horsham in Sussex and remained in this pastorate for 21 years until just before his death on November 13, 1874. He was buried in the churchyard.\n\nThe tune, THE SOLID ROCK, was composed in 1863 by William Batchelder Bradbury (1816-1868; see Biographies), and appeared in his Devotional Hymn and Tune Book, 1864. The music consists of two identical halves, and the harmony is almost entirely composed of the three major chords. See SDAH 200, “The Lord Is Coming,” for Melvin West’s (1903-; see Biographies) harmonization of this tune.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Louisa M. R. Stead was born in Dover, England, about 1850 and was converted at the age of 9. She emigrated to the United States in 1871 and settled in Cincinnati, Ohio. At a camp meeting she volunteered to do missionary work in China but was rejected because of ill health. Later she married, but after a few years, while on summer holiday, she witnessed her husband lose his life in a gallant attempt to rescue a boy who was struggling against the undertow off a Long Island Beach. She was left with her 4-year-old Daughter, Lily, without adequate support. On one occasion she was reduced to such impoverished circumstances that there was no food left in the house. Her prayer to the Lord to provide was answered miraculously the next morning when she found a basket of groceries, and money, on her doorstep. This experience led her to write the words of this hymn.\n\nStead’s early desire was to be fulfilled, for she emigrated to South Africa on her own and was a missionary in Cape Colony for 15 years. In 19000 she married Robert Wodehouse, a South African Methodist minister. However, ill health caused them to go to America, where her husband served as a local Methodist pastor. They were able to return to South Africa and were missionaries in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) until her death at Penkridges, near Umtali, on January 18, 1917.\n\nThe tune, unnamed but sometimes called TRUST IN JESUS, was composed especially for these words by William JAMES Kirkpatrick (1838-1921; see Biographies), and appeared in his Songs of Triumph, 1882, compiled by himself and John Robson Sweney (see Biographies).\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "William Orcutt Cushing (1823-1902; see SDAH 208) was requested by Ira D.  Sankey (1840-1908; see Biographies) to send something new to help him in his gospel work of singing sacred solos at evangelistic revival meetings. Cushing accepted this request as a call from God, and prayed that the Lord would give him a song that would glorify Him. He later said that this hymn, written in 1876 in Moravia, New York, was the outgrowth of many tears, heart conflicts, and soul yearnings, of which the world could know nothing. The history of many spiritual battles was behind it. Note the constant reference to Christ as the Rock—four times in three stanzas and once in the refrain, plus one reference to Him as a refuge. Cushing drew most of his allusions from the Psalms. Three more of his hymns in SDAH ate No. 208, “There’ll Be No Dark Valley”; No. 218, “When He Cometh”; and No. 529, “Under His Wings.”\n\nThe tune, sometimes called HIDING IN THEE, was composed by Ira D. Sankey and first appeared in Welcome Tidings, 1877, a collection of Gospel songs compiled by Sankey and two Colleagues.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Gloria Gaither, born March 4, 1942, into a modest Battle Creek, Michigan parsonage, could be characterized as wife mother, lyricist, author, speaker, recording artist, and performer. After graduating from Anderson College, Indiana, with majors in English, French, and sociology, she married noted songwriter Bill Gaither, and with him had coauthored some 500 songs. Since 1971 she has written four books on inspirational subject. She sings and travels with the Bill Gaither Trio, reaching as many as 500,000 people in a year. Of her ability as a creative communicator she says: “Much of my growing has come as a result of my children or some phase of family life. God is not complex. He speaks to us in ultimate simplicity. I cannot let what He has given me go to waste. I must act responsibly to do the most with what I have and trust the results to Him.”\n\nBill Gaither, coauthor of the words and composer of the music he titled RESURRECTION, was born March 28, 1936, at Alexander, Indiana. While a lad on the farm, he was keenly interested in gospel music. After listening to male quartets on the radio early in the morning, he would order the songbooks through the mail and learn the songs himself. With his future wife, Gloria, as a fellow student, he attended Anderson College, where he earned a B.A. degree. While teaching high school English, literature, and journalism at the college (Gloria taught there also), he formed the Gaither Music Company to published the songs he was writing and singing in churches of the Midwest. After their marriage in 1962, they began a full-time ministry of writing and publishing songs, recording, and concertizing with the Bill Gaither Trio. In a short time they became widely known for their ability to communicate “the resurrection principle in the daily life” through the idiom of Christian song. Phenomenal success has attended their efforts. Literally hundreds of Christian artists have made recordings of their songs “The King Is Coming,” “He Touched Me,” “Something Beautiful,” and “There’s Something AboutThat Name.”\n\nIn 1973 Gaither’s alma mater conferred on him an honorary D.Mus. For “Because He Lives,” both the Gospel Music Association and ASCAP (American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers) named Bill the “Gospel Songwriter of the Year” in 1974. A host of honors and awards have come to this talented couple, and they continue to write their gospel songs, record them in their own studio, and operate Alexandria House, a music publishing, printing, and distribution organization in their hometown of Alexandria, Indiana.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Hugh Stowell printed this hymn in the Winter’s Wreath, 1828, under the title “Peace at the Mercy Seat.” There were six stanzas, revised in 1831. SDAH’s stanzas 5 should precede stanza 4 as in the original, for the latter answers the former.\n\nStowell was born in Douglas, Isle of Man, England, on December 3, 1799. He earned a B.A. at Oxford in 1822 and received his M.A. in 1826. He began his ministry as a curate in Gloucestershire, then moved to Huddersfield in Yorkshire and then to Salford, in Lancashire. He was appointed rector in Christ Church, Salford, in 1831 and then in 1845 canon of Chester Cathedral. In 1851 he became chaplain to the bishop of Manchester. He was an excellent preacher, and published many sermons and pamphlets and several books. He wrote nearly 50 hymns, mostly for Sunday school anniversaries in Christ Church, Salford. He died in Salford on October 8, 1865.\n\nRETREAT was composed by Thomas Hastings (1784-1872; see SDAH 300). It was so named because it was especially written for these words, which describe the retreat from life’s cares and problems that can be found at the mercy seat. It consists of chords of the tonic (more than half), the dominant, and the subdominant, with the upper parts moving generally in thirds and sixths. Hastings also composed SDAH 300, TOPLADY; and SDAH 601, ZION; and wrote the words of the third stanza of SDAH 477, “Come, Ye Disconsolate.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Horatio Gates Spafford planned a trip to Europe for his wife and family, but at the last minute he had to remain at home on business so he sent them on ahead. His wife, Anna Lawson Spafford, and their four daughters, Maggie, Tanetta, Annie, and Bessie, aged from 18 months to 12 years, embarked on the ship Ville du Havre in November 1873. Unfortunately the ship collided with an English sailing ship, the Loch Earn, off Newfoundland and sank within half an hour. Mrs. Spafford was rescued, but all four children were drowned, the baby being washed from her mother’s grasp. Ten days later, when the survivors were landed at Cardiff in Wales, she sent a cable to her anxious husband, “Saved alone.” Spafford sailed across the Atlantic to meet his wife, and both of them met the evangelist Dwight L. Moody in Liverpool. He comforted them in their tragic bereavement and noted their expression of trust and confidence in God in spite of their deep personal sorrow. “It is well,” they said, “the will of God be done.” Spafford had the cabled message framed and hung in his office, and on the occasion of Ira D. Sankey’s visit in 1876 again expressed his resignation to God’s will. It was then that he was inspired to his thoughts into verse, and this hymn was written two years after the tragedy.\n\nOne stanza is omitted in SDAH: Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come, Let this blest assurance control,\nThat Christ hath regarded my helpless estate,\nAnd hath shed His own blood for my soul.\n\nThe recurring theme recalls the incident of the Shunammite woman and Elisha and his servant: “Is it well with thee?… It is well” (2 Kings 4:26).\n\nSpafford was born on October 20, 1828, at North Troy, New York. In 1856 he moved to Chicago, where he established a legal practice. An active Presbyterian, he was an elder in one of the churches in Chicago. He was also a Sunday school teacher and active in the YMCA. He and his wife were always interested in the Holy Land, settling in Jerusalem in 1881. They founded the American colony there. He died in Jerusalem on October 16, 1888.\n\nThe tune VILLE DU HAVRE, from the name of the ship, is also called IT IS WELL; it was composed especially for these words by Philip P. Bliss (1838-1876; see SDAH 286). It appeared in Gospel Hymns, No. 2, 1876, edited by Sankey and Bliss. Bliss also wrote the words and music of SDAH 286, “Wonderful Words of Life,” to an unnamed tune, and SDAH 343, “I Will Sing of My Redeemer.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

Belden printed the word doeth in italics in that book and again when the hymn was printed in Christ in Song, 1900. go The tune, unnamed, was composed by Belden.

    "historicalContext": "This is one of the 14 hymns that poured forth from the pen of Carolina Sandell Berg (1832-1903; see SDAH 101) right after the tragic death of her father in a boating accident. She found comfort in putting her thoughts into verse, expressing an unswerving faith in the love and protection of a caring heavenly Father.\n\nSeveral of Carolina’s poems were set to music and made popular by Oscar Ahnfelt, a “singing evangelist.” Ahnfelt traveled all over the Scandinavian countries, singing these hymns to the accompaniment of his guitar. Once while visiting in the home of the famous soprano Jenny Lind, the “Swedish Nightingale,” he told her he would like to publish a book of Carolina’s songs. Lind was glad to finance the project, and soon Andeliga Sanger, 1850, was published.\n\nIn his book The Story of Christian Hymnody, Ernest Ryden tells this story regarding the opposition encountered by Ahnfelt and Carl Rosenius, the Pietist preacher with whom he worked:\n\n“At one time King Karl XV was petitioned to forbid Ahnfelt’s preaching and singing. The monarch refused until he had had an opportunity to hear the ‘spiritual troubadour.’ Ahnfelt was commanded to appear at the royal palace. Being considerably perturbed in mind as to what he should sing to his monarch, he besought Lina Sandell to write a special hymn. She was equal to the occasion, and within a few days the song was ready. With his guitar under his arm and the hymn in his pocket, Ahnfelt repaired to the palace and sang: Who is it that knocketh upon your heart’s door In peaceful eve?\nWho is it that brings to the wounded and sore The balm that can heal and relieve? Your heart is still restless, it findeth no peace In earth’s pleasures;\nYour soul is still yearning, it seeketh release To rise to the heavenly treasures.\n\nThe king listened with moist eyes. When Ahnfelt had finished, the monarch gripped him by the hand and exclaimed: ‘You may sing as much as you desire in both of my kingdoms!”\n\nAhnfelt, born at Gullarp, Skane Province, Sweden, was the son of a Swedish pastor. He grew up in a home full of music and good literature. He studied for the ministry at Lund University but lost interest and went to Stockholm to study music. After meeting the great preacher Rosenius, he devoted the rest of his life to music evangelism. He died October 22, 1882.\n\nAndrew Skoog, who translated the poem from Swedish to English, was born December 17, 1856, in Varmland, Sweden, but immigrated with his folks to St. Paul, Minnesota, at the age of 13. Although educated formally only through the sixth grade, he became successful in many different lines- teaching, selling, writing, publishing, printing, photography, directing the choir and playing the organ, editing, and composing music. At one time he served on the Minneapolis City Council and was superintendent of the largest Sunday school in that city. He edited seven hymnals and assisted with the first three hymnals published by the Evangelical Covenant Church of America. He died October 30, 1934.\n\nBLOTT EN DAG, the first words of the hymn in Swedish, literally means, “Only a Day” or in the context, “Day by Day,” as translated. The arrangement of this tune is by Melvin West (1930-; see Biographies).\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "William Hiley Bathurst (1796-1877; see SDAH 264) wrote this hymn, which appears in his Psalms and Hymns, 1831. It was entitled “The Power of Faith” and was based on the request of the disciples to the Lord, “Increase our faith” (Luke 17:5). Originally there were six stanzas.\n\nNORTHFIELD was composed in the town of that name in Massachu- setts, by Jeremiah Ingalls (1764-1828; see SDAH 236). He had stopped in a tavern and ordered his dinner, and wondered how long he would have to wait for it. This started a train of thought that led to his recalling the hymn by Isaac Watts (1674-1748) that begins, “Lo, what a glorious sight appears” (see SDAH 446).\n\nThe last stanza reads:\nHow long, dear Savior, oh, how long\nShall this bright hour delay?\nFly swifter round, ye wheels of time! And bring the welcome day.\n\nThe phrase “How long?” led Ingalls to compose this tune in Common Meter. The original was a fuguing tune, which can be found in Hymns and Tunes, 1886. It was arranged in regular four-part harmony by Harold Hannum, editor of Church Hymnal, 1941. Ingalls also preserved the tune I LOVE THEE, in his Christian Harmony, 1805.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

Born December 15, 1837, in Kent, he was a choirboy at Canterbury Cathedral and studied music with William H. Monk (see SDAH 50). Trained for the ministry at King’s College, London, he became a scholar in Greek and Hebrew, and in 1881 was honored by the archbishop of Canterbury with the Lambeth D.D. He wrote several hymn tunes, but this is the only one that has survived.

    "historicalContext": "At a time when astronauts are exploring the vast reaches of space, it is good for us to be reminded that God is the one who keeps it all going.\n\nCatherine Arnott Cameron was born March 27, 1927, in Canada, but is now an American citizen. She is associate professor of social psychology at the University of La Verne, La Verne, California. According to her, “The hymn was written over a period of several months at a time when I was experiencing a new sense of direction, growth, and creativity in my life. I wrote it to go with the tune AUSTRIA, by Haydn” (see SDAH 423). It was first published in Contemporary Worship-1, 1969; several alterations were made before its inclusion in Lutheran Book of Worship, 1978.\n\nThis is one of the texts sent out by the committee to some 30 Seventh-day Adventist composers, with the request for an original tune. HENISEE was chosen for its modern sound, in keeping with the contemporary concerns of the poem. Regarding the writing of this tune the composer said, “The inspiration behind writing HENISEE came from the hymn ‘Rejoice, Ye Pure in Heart’ (see SDAH 27). I wanted to write a tune that would be so inspirational that people would enjoy it and want to sing it often.” t RG Eurydice Valenis Osterman, born in 1950, is the daughter of the late Francis A. Osterman, one of the first graduates of the ministerial course at Oakwood College, Huntsville, Alabama.\n\nEurydice began formal music training at age 6, and during high school was active in playing for church and evangelistic meetings. At Andrews University she wrote songs for and accompanied a ladies trio and composed a major organ work for her senior recital. After graduating with a B.A. in 1972 and an M.A. in 1975, she taught music at Mount Vernon Academy, Mount Vernon, Ohio, and at Berean Elementary School, Baton Rouge, Louisiana. At this writing she is a teacher in the Music Department at Oakwood College, where she is conductor of the college choir. From Andrews University have come awards for her choral piece “Alleluia,” 1982, and for an arrangement of the spiritual “O What a Beautiful City,” 1983. She teaches and travels with the choir, and is in demand for lectures and workshops relating to church music.\nShe also arranged for SDAH the spiritual “I Want Jesus to Walk With Me,” No. 624.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "In the spring of 1862 Joseph Henry Gilmore, a Baptist minister, visited the city of Philadelphia. He was invited to address the midweek prayer meeting at the First Baptist Church. He spoke there of God’s leadership, using part of the Shepherd Psalm as a basis for his talk. He was so impressed by the simple words “He leadeth me” that he continued to discuss this theme at the home of his host, Deacon Wattson of Arch Street, Philadelphia. His mind was so full of the thought of God’s guidance in every phase of life that there and then he wrote these four stanzas in pencil, and passed them on to his wife without comment. Without telling her husband, she sent the poem to a religious periodical, The Watchman and Reflector, in Boston. It appeared in print in the December 4, 1862, issue, still without his knowledge. Three years later Gilmore was to preach in the Baptist church in Rochester, New York. Taking up a hymnbook and opening it at random, he was astonished to find his own poem set to music. He did not recognize nor acknowledge his authorship of the refrain until his wife’s death some years later, when he discovered his original manuscript among her papers, complete with a refrain, but of two lines only.\n\nThe words are a very free paraphrase of part of the Shepherd Psalm: “He leadeth me beside the still waters. Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me” (Ps. 23:2, 4).\n\nGilmore was born in Boston on April 29, 1834, and educated at Brown University and Newton Theological Seminary. He was ordained into the Baptist ministry in 1862 and served at Fisherville, New Hampshire, for a year. Then he was private secretary to his father, the governor of New Hampshire, but after one year he began pastoring the Baptist church in Rochester, New York. In 1868 he was appointed professor of logic and English literature at the University of Rochester; he held that position until he retired in 1911. He died at Rochester on July 23, 1918.\n\nThe tune, sometimes called HE LEADETH ME, or AUGHTON, composed by William Batchelder Bradbury (1816-1868; see Biographies),\nand published in his The Golden Censer, 1864. He had noticed Gilmore’s hymn in The Watchman and Reflector, enlarged the refrain, and wrote his tune to fit the words.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "William Williams was concerned over the obvious lack of good hymns W in Welsh. This constituted a continual challenge to produce better ones, which this enthusiastic Welshman did to such effect that he became known as the “Welsh Watts” and the “sweet singer of Wales.” He wrote this hymn in Welsh, and it appeared in his Alleluia in 1745 under the title “Strength to Pass Through the Wilderness.” It was translated into English by Williams’ friend Peter Williams and was printed in his Hymns an Various Subjects, 1771, using stanzas 1, 3, and 5 of the original hymn. William Williams being bilingual, then made his own translation; this appeared first in leaflet form and then in 1772 in Collection of Hymns Sung in the Countess of Huntingdon’s Chapels. The SDAH hymn consists of Peter’s stanza 1 and William’s stanzas 2 and 3.\n\nThe hymn likens the Christian life to the march of the Israelites through the wilderness of Sinai to the Promised Land of Canaan, led by a powerful God who provided their sustenance.\n\nWilliam Williams was born on February 11, 1717, at Cefn-y-Coed, northeast of Llandovery, in what was then the county of Carmarthen. The son of a wealthy farmer, he intended to study medicine at the Llwynllwyd Academy in Carmarthen. But he forsook this aim after coming under the influence of Howell Harris, one of George Whitefield’s preachers, at one of his open-air meetings. William dedicated himself to the ministry and was ordained deacon in the Established Church in 1740. He served as curate in the small villages of Llanwrtyd and Abergwesyn, near Llandovery. How- ever, his evangelistic views prevented him from further progress in that church. He joined the Calvinistic Methodists and became an itinerant preacher, traveling extensively in his native Wales and covering about 3,000 miles a year. Harris encouraged him to write hymns, and his first book Alleluia was so successful that he continued until he had written more than 800 hymns in Welsh and more than 100 in English. He also wrote two long poems, some tracts, and many elegies. After more than 45 years of preaching, he died at Pantycelyn, near Llandovery, on January 11, 1791.\n\nPeter Williams was born on January 7, 1722, at Llansadurnin, a small town near the inlet into Carmarthen Bay. He was educated at the Grammar School in Carmarthen and while there was converted by George Whitefield. He trained for the ministry and was ordained in 1744, serving first as curate at Eglwys Cymmyn, where he founded a school. However, being too vehement in his preaching to suit the staid established church, in 1746 he left became an itinerant preacher, fervent and eloquent, but because of a charge of the Church of England and joined the Welsh Calvinistic Methodists. He heresy, he was expelled from the Methodists. So he built a chapel of his own in Carmarthen and continued preaching there until his death on August 8, 1790, at Llandyfeilog, Wales. From 1767 to 1770 he published a family edition of the Welsh Bible with a commentary, and with a concordance in 1773. He also published a Welsh hymnbook in 1759 and his Hymns on\nVarious Subjects in 1771.\n\nFor a discussion of the tune CWM RHONDDA and John Hughes (1873-1932) see SDAH 201.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

The four stanzas SDAH has are selected from 28 stanzas, each of two lines only, in the original of this hymn and Wesley’s following one, “Lamb of God, I Look to Thee.”\n\nIn the 1767 edition of Hymns for Little Children Wesley added and Others of Riper Years to the title, showing that more hymns were included for children who no longer were little in size or ability. John Wesley wrote in a preface in 1790: “There are two ways of writing or speaking to children: the one is to let ourselves down to them; the other, to lift them up to us. Dr. Watts has written in the former way and has succeeded admirably well, speaking to children as children and leaving them as he found them. The following hymns are written on the other plan; they contain strong and manly sense, yet expressed in such plain and easy language, as even children may understand. But when they do understand them, they will be children no longer, only in years and stature.” This hymn is universally loved and found in a multitude of hymnbooks.\n\nGENTLE JESUS was composed by Martin Shaw (1875-1958; see Biographies) while at his first position of organist-choirmaster at St. Mary’s, Primrose Hill, London. It was printed in Additional Tunes and Settings, 1915. The utter simplicity of the melody and harmony make this a hymn that children can quickly learn and sing.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Frances Ridley Havergal (1836-1879; see Biographies) wrote this hymn at Winterdyne, near Bewdley, Worcestershire, on April 28, 1872, under the title “A Prayer, ‘None of Us Liveth Unto Himself.” ” SDAH has the first three stanzas only. Many of Havergal’s poems were first printed as leaflets. This one was printed by William Parlane in 1872.\n\nCANONBURY is an arrangement from a piano piece taken from “Nachtstücke,” Opus 23, composed in 1839 by Robert Alexander Schumann. He was born June 8, 1810, at Zwickau, south of Leipzig, East Germany. When he was 16 his father died, and his mother sent him to Leipzig to study law. However, he devoted much of his time to the study of piano, and in spite of being sent to Heidelberg and then to Italy, he pursued his musical interest. In 1840 he married Clara Wieck, the daughter of his former piano teacher. She was an excellent pianist and was instrumental in making her husband’s compositions known. Unfortunately, Schumann suffered a permanent injury to his right hand in 1832 and was forced to give up his career as a pianist. However, he concentrated successfully on composition and produced a large number of piano pieces and songs, as well as symphonies, choral works, and chamber music. Toward the end of his life he suffered severe depression and attempted to drown himself in the Rhine in 1854. His last two years were spent, at his own request, in an asylum near Bonn; he died July 29, 1856.\n\nCANONBURY is also used for SDAH 548, “Now Praise the Hidden God of Love”; and SDAH 686, “Bless Thou the Gifts.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Born in 1886 in London, England, Philip Edwin Gregory graduated from London City College. He was ordained in 1909 and moved to the United States, where he served as pastor of churches in Wisconsin and Illinois. The Congregational church near the University of Minnesota was where he began holding services in a small house and later in an art his flock for 17 years. In 1946 he was called to Laguna Beach, California, gallery. He led out in the building of the Neighborhood Congregational Church, Laguna Beach. After retirement in 1956 at age 70, he was not ready yet to succumb to the rocking chair so he accepted interim pastoral assignments in Omaha and Lincoln, Nebraska; Salt Lake City, Utah; Tucson, Arizona; and Palos Verdes, California.\n\nActive all his life in community service, he served as chairman of the committee that established South Coast Community Hospital, was a 50-year member of the Boy Scouts, and was president of the local Red Cross. He died in 1974.\n\nA member of the Hymn Society of America, Gregory wrote many hymns. This one was created to meet a need for a hymn to be sung at baby dedication services. The first stanza brings the children to Jesus, much the same as mothers did in Mark 10:13-16 and Matthew 18:2-4.\n\nStanza 2 is a prayer for parents and those who will guide them into useful lives. In the Topical Index of SDAH there are two hymns under “Child Dedication.” This one, although in the “Guidance” section, could be appropriately used for this service by singing the first stanza as the parents bring the child to the front, and the second at the conclusion, as they are returning to their seats.\n\nThis text was sent out by the hymnal committee with a number of others to 30 or more SDA composers, asking for submission of new tunes. Wayne Hooper’s (1920-; see Biographies) TENDER SONG was selected. He says the name was chosen to reflect the tenderness in Jesus’ heart as He lovingly received the little ones into His arms and remonstrated with those who would drive the children away.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "These words were written by Walter John Mathams at the special request of the Psalms and Hymns committee of the Scottish Baptist Union. It was published in Psalms and Hymns for School and Home, 1882.\n\nMathams was born in London on October 30, 1853. He went to sea at an early age. He was shipwrecked, forced to undergo army service in Brazil, joined the Alaska gold rush, and then returned to England via Palestine. In 1874 he decided to train for the Baptist ministry. His first pastorate was at Preston, Lancashire, but he suffered from ill health and went to Australia in 1879. He returned in 1883 and was appointed to Falkirk. He served in Birmingham from 1888 to 1900 when he joined the Church of Scotland. He was appointed chaplain to the Scottish forces in Egypt from 1900 to 1902, reordained in 1905, and then ministered in the Orkney Islands and Inverness-shire until retirement in 1919. He died at Swanage, Dorset, on January 29, 1931. In addition to some other hymns, he wrote religious books in popular style. This present hymn is more than a children’s hymn because it covers childhood, youth, and old age, the progression of thought requesting Jesus to be a friend for the whole period of life.\n\nSIMONSIDE was composed by the Seventh-day Adventist pastor, poet, and musician, Joseph Harker (1880-1970; see SDAH 265) after he had read Matham’s words several times and meditated about the life and character of the author. It was named to commemorate the name of the street in Newcastle-on-Tyne, England, where Harker lived and taught music for many years. He also composed SDAH 265, PARACLETE.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "historicalContext": "This paraphrase is a metrical psalm and follows as closely as possible the language of the Authorized (King James) Version of Psalm 23. Compare SDAH 197, 513, and 537, which are free paraphrases of the same psalm. These words are based on the 1641 version by Frances Rous (1524-1579), who married the sister of John Calvin, and who in 1556 wh wrote 51 of the psalms of David in metrical form. The divines of the Westminster Assembly made a further revision, and it was altered again before appearing in the Scottish Psalter of 1650. For more on this book, see SDAH 62, “How Lovely Is Thy Dwelling Place.” Other hymns in SDAH from the Scottish Psalter are Nos. 19, 63, and 552.\n\nBrother James was the nickname taken by James Leith Macbeth Bain, born about 1840 in Scotland, who was a mystical poet, writer, and spiritual healer. He fluctuated from belief to agnosticism, and back again to a belief in divine love. He formed a Brotherhood of Healers (who went about treating people for both spiritual and physical illnesses), writing poems and singing to the patients as a part of the healing process. In 1906 he published a book, The Brotherhood of Healers. Being a Message to All Practical Mystics… and an Introduction to the Study of Essential Principles of Spiritual, Psychic and Mental Healing. Toward the end of his life he worked for the slum dwellers of Liverpool, and at a home for children. He died September19, 1925.\n\nThe musical arrangement SDAH uses is adapted from an anthem by Gordon Percival Septimus Jacob, born near London, July 5, 1895. He was a British composer with a D.Mus., a teacher at the Royal College of Music, and a writer of the book Orchestral Technique, 1931. His works include two symphonies, four orchestral suites, six concerti, and vocal and chamber music. He retired in Saffron Walden, Essex.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "historicalContext": "Mary Elizabeth Byrne (born in Dublin on July 2, 1880), an authority Lon ancient Irish religious poetry, coauthored the Old and Mid-Irish Dictionary for the Royal Irish Academy. She translated this poem, which dates from the eighth century, and published it as prose in the Irish journal, Erin, Vol. II. She died in Dublin on January 19, 1931. Eleanor Henrietta Hull, born January 15, 1860, in Manchester, brilliant author, and founder of the Irish Text Society, reduced the 16 prose couplets to 12 rhymed ones and published them in her Poem Book of the Gael, 1912. She died at Wimbledon, January 13, 1935. Most hymnals print only eight of the couplets, arranged in four stanzas. Two other couplets form the omitted third stanza:\n\nBe Thou my battle-shield, my sword for the fight, Be Thou my dignity, Thou my delight;\nThou my soul’s shelter, Thou my high Tower: Raise Thou me heavenward, O Power of my power.\n\nSLANE is the name of a hill near Tara in County Meath, Ireland, where it is said Saint Patrick (c. 389-461) lit the Paschal fire on Easter Eve, going against the Druid priests’ order that no one light the fire before theirs was lit. The melody comes from an Irish folk song, “With My Love on the Road,” published by Patrick Weston Joyce in Old Irish Folk Music and Songs, 1909. The melodic structure is ABCD, that is, all four lines are different, with no repetition as found in most hymns. Typically Irish is the wide range and the final ending on three repeated tonic notes. The tune was first used with these words in the English Church Hymnary, 1927, as arranged by David Evans (1847-1948; see Biographies), the great Welsh music teacher and composer. SLANE is also used for SDAH 320, “Lord of Creation,” with different harmony.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "This hymn is from Jane Leeson’s (1807-1882; see SDAH Hymns and Scenes of Childhood; or, A Sponsor’s Gift, 1842. It had three stanzas of eight lines each, headed with John 10:27: “My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.” The last two lines of SDAH’s last stanza originally were:\nTill before my Father’s throne, I shall know as I am known.\n\nIt should be pointed out that an obvious error in the original poem been perpetuated in later hymnbooks. The last line in stanza 2 says “straight and narrow way,” but should of course be “strait” as in Matthew 7:14, meaning “narrow,” as opposed to “wide” or “broad” (verse 13). Considerably altered by later editors, the SDAH version preserves three four-line stanzas, the first of which reflects John 10:28.\n\nThis interesting history of ORIENTIS PARTIBUS is given in Handbook to the Church Hymnary, 1927:\n\n“In some parts of France, notably at Beauvais, during the Middle Ages, there was celebrated on January 14 a church festival known as the Feast of the Ass. It was intended to commemorate the flight into Egypt. On this occasion a young woman holding a child in her arms was seated on an ass, and after a procession through the streets of the town, the ass with its burden was led into the principal church, and took its stand beside the high altar while the mass was celebrated. During the service a hymn was sung, written in a mixture of medieval Latin and old French (‘macaronic’), of which the first lines were Orientis partibus adventavit asinus’ (‘from Eastern regions the ass has come’).”\n\nThe melody of this hymn has been preserved, and from it the present tune was adapted; it was published by Richard Redhead (see SDAH 157) in his Church Hymn Tunes, 1853. Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872-1948; see Biographies) arranged this tune in a carol-like triple.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

She lived for 12 years in upper Michigan before her Finnish-Polish family settled in southern California. Her hymn texts have been written mostly for her brother, composer Dale Wood. Together they collaborated to create “Every Flower That Grows” as a choral anthem for children. Titled “A Hymn of Youth,” the anthem was published by Augsburg Publishing House, Minneapolis, in 1967. Mrs. Lazicki is the mother of six children, four of whom are now serving in full-time Christian ministry. Her son Stephen, also an author of many anthem texts, is a Lutheran missionary in Cameroon, West Africa. At present, Fern assists her husband, Ted, in writing children’s stories and plays for religious publications.\n\nFor LAUREL and Dale Wood (1934- ) see SDAH 42.

When the hymn was printed in Spiritual Songs, 1878, he revealed that he was the author. There were three other stanzas.\n\nHopper was born on February 17, 1818, in New York City. He graduated from its university and then proceeded to the Union Theological Seminary in New York, where he graduated in 1842. He pastored some Presbyterian churches in New York State, but he spent most of his ministry at the Church of the Sea and Land in New York City; therefore, he had much to do with seafaring men in his work. He wrote two other hymns and died in New York on April 23, 1888.\n\nJohn Edgar Gould, the son of a sea captain, composed the tune PILOT in 1871 especially for these words. He was born in Bangor, Maine, in 1822 and published several hymnbooks. He was also a conductor and composed several hymn tunes. By the age of 30 he had a music publishing shop on Broadway, New York City; later he entered into partnership in a retail piano business in Philadelphia with William Gustavus Fischer (see SDAH 307). He suffered ill health and went for a trip to southern Europe and North Africa to recuperate, but died at Algiers on March 4, 1875.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "For comments on this close paraphrase of Psalm 23, see SDAH 546. For comments on the Scottish Psalter see SDAH 62.\n\nThe identity of the composer of the tune CRIMOND (a village 33 miles north of Aberdeen, Scotland) was in doubt until hymnologist Millar Patrick cleared it in an article in the Bulletin of the British Hymns Society:\n\n“In the Scottish Psalter it is ascribed to David Grant (1833-1893), an Aberdeen [Scotland] tobacconist who was a musical enthusiast and had a flair for skillful harmonization. This attribution is a mistake. The tune was composed by Jessie Seymour Irvine, a daughter of the manse of Crimond, one of the parishes in the northeastern part of Aberdeenshire, known as Buchan. Her father was a minister there in the middle of the [nineteenth] century. The people of the district are firm in their conviction that Jessie wrote the tune, and their belief was corroborated by her sister in 1911, who was then 82 years old.\n\n“Having written the tune, she had no skill for harmonizing it, and so sent it to William Carnie, once famous in the Northeast as a conductor and teacher, and as editor of the Northern Psalter [1872], which he was then compiling. Carnie, recognizing its merit, handed it to Grant to put it into shape for of authorship as he did, unless the tune as submitted by Miss Irvine needed publication. It is difficult to understand why Grant tacitly accepted the credit some reshaping as well as harmonizing.”\n\nThis combination of words and music was sung at the wedding of Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II) and Prince Philip, and also at a service in St. Paul’s Cathedral for the silver wedding anniversary of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. So CRIMOND is firmly established as the tune for Psalm 23 in England.\n\nJessie Seymour Irvine was born July 26, 1836, at Dunnottar, near Stonehaven, Scotland; she was the daughter of the parish minister there. She moved with him when he served at Peterhead and then at Crimond, where she wrote the tune. She died September 2, 1887, at the age of 51 at Aberdeen, Scotland.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "Count Nicholaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf (1700-1760; see SDAH 177), was the author of this hymn. Actually, it is a combination of two of his other hymns, namely three stanzas from Seelenbräutigam (Souls of the Bridegroom), written in September 1721, and one stanza from Glanz der Ewigkeit (Brightness of Eternity), written in May of the same year. The combination appeared as four stanzas of six lines each in the Brüder Gesangbuch (Hymnal for the Brethren) of 1778, a considerable condensation of the 11 stanzas and 15 stanzas, respectively, of the hymns mentioned above. Its title was “Jesu geh’ voran” (Jesus, Go Before, or Lead the Way). The SDAH translation is by Arthur Tozer Russell; it was made in 1846 and appeared in his Psalms and Hymns, 1851. Zinzendorf also wrote SDAH 177, “Jesus, Your Blood and Righteousness,” translated by John Wesley.\n\nRussell was born on March 20, 1806, at Northhampton in the East Midlands of England. He was the son of a minister, Thomas Clout, who changed his name to Russell. The son followed his father’s calling and trained for the ministry at Cambridge University; he was ordained in 1829. He was vicar at Caxton, near Cambridge, for 22 years, then in Liverpool for 14 years, followed by seven years at Wrockwardine, near Telford in Shropshire. His last appointment was as rector at Southwick, near Brighton, but after only a few months there, he died on November 18, 1874. He wrote several theological works and biographies, and composed some hymn tunes, as well as two other collections of hymns.\n\nSEELENBRÄUTIGAM is a melody composed in 1697 by Adam Drese for his hymn that began, as did Zinzendorf’s, with the depiction of Jesus as the bridegroom of souls. The melody proceeds almost entirely by steps, and the first score melody is repeated in the last score. Drese was born in Darmstadt in December 1620 and was sponsored by Duke Wilhelm of Weimar to study in Warsaw. On his return to Weimar in 1655 he was appointed choir director. When the duke died in 1662, his son took Drese to years later. Jena as his secretary; he appointed him as mayor of the town 10 years later.\n\nIn 1683 Prince Anton Gunther appointed him as choir director at Arnstadt, not far west of both Weimar and Jena, where he died on February 15, 1701. He was a devout Pietist and is said to have burned all his opera and secular compositions after he was converted. Pietism was a movement in Germany that emphasized practical religion in a Lutheranism that had become arid and formal.\n\nThe tune was harmonized by Samuel Sebastian Wesley (1810-1876; see SDAH 273).\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

Lillian Dale Avery-Stuttle (1855-1933) was a student at Battle Creek College, Michigan, in the late 1870s and became an editorial worker. A woman of deep devotion, faith, and courage, she was the author of many beautiful poems and several books. One of her poems, “The Riven Veil,” appeared on the front page of the Review and Herald dated March 16, 1933, one day before her death. Avery-Stuttle expected to be one of the glorious company who would be alive and faithful at the second advent of Jesus, and who, like Enoch, would be “translated that he should not see death” (Heb. 11:5). This hymn, based on Genesis 5:24, “And Enoch walked with God,” was her own favorite.\n\nThe tune MORTON was composed by Edwin Barnes (1864-1930; see SDAH 6), and copyrighted by the J. E. White Publishing Company for inclusions in Hymns and Tunes, 1886. It was named to commemorate Eliza H.

    "historicalContext": "This hymn is the earliest Christian one extant. It appeared in a book of philosophy, written in Greek, entitled The Tutor. The author was Titus Flavius Clemens (c. 170-c. 220), known as Clement of Alexandria. Born in Athens, he had a very inquiring mind and seriously studied Assyrian, Egyptian, Greek, and Jewish sources in order to discover truth. He moved to Alexandria and, after studying the writings of the early Christian fathers, was converted to Christianity. He became a teacher and later the principal in the Christian school in Alexandria. The purpose of his book was to present Jesus Christ as the perfect tutor and to erect a bulwark against the inroads of paganism. Under the persecution of Christians during the reign of the emperor Lucius Septimius Severus, c. A.D. 203, Clemens fled; he is presumed to have died about the year A.D. 220.\n\nThe Tutor included two poems, this one entitled “A Hymn of the Savior.” The complete hymn presents many types of Christ, some of them not found in the Scriptures, for example: Bridle of colts untamed, Wing of wandering birds, Rudder of youth unbending, Shepherd with wisdom tending, Curb of the stubborn steed, Helm for the ships. The four stanzas of the SDAH hymn present Him as King, Lord, Word, High Priest, Guide, Shepherd, and the Christ. The hymn was translated freely from the Greek in 1846 by Henry Martyn Dexter for use in his sermon based on Deuteronomy 32:7: “Remember the days of old,” in which he preached on some prominent characteristics of early Christians.\n\nDexter was born in Plympton, Massachusetts, on August 13, 1821, and educated at Yale and Andover Theological Seminary. In 1844 he was ordained as a Congregational minister and appointed to Manchester, New Hampshire. He moved to Boston in 1848 and ministered there until 1867, when he became editor of The Congregationalist. His hymn had appeared in this magazine on December 21, 1849. Dexter died in 1890.\n\nKIRBY BEDON, which means “the church near Bedon,” a village near Norwich, Norfolk, England, was composed in 1887 by Edward Bunnett. He was born on June 26, 1834, in Norfolk. He was a chorister in the Norwich Cathedral, then he worked as a deputy organist there, with Zechariah Buck, for 22 years. A good singer also, he sang “Lift Thine Eyes” with the famous Jenny Lind and a Miss Dolby in 1849. For some years he was organist at St. Peter Mancroft, conducted the Norwich Musical Union, and was organist for the Norwich Musical Festivals. He wrote cantatas, hymn tunes, carols, anthems, part-songs, service music, and organ pieces. He died January 5, 1923.\n\nThe melody shows an interesting structure-phrases 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 each have a quarter note followed by two eighth notes. Furthermore, phrase 2 is exactly one tone above phrase 1, and phrase 4 is exactly one tone above 5. Then in contrast, phrase 6 ascends, whereas the other phrases mentioned descend. Each one of the four parts has an interesting melody of its own.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "On April 9, 1979, Frank von Christierson celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of his ordination to the ministry. Born on Christmas Day of 1900 in Lovisa, a small town 50 miles east of Helsinki, Finland, he came at age 5 with his parents to live in America, first in Norman, Oklahoma, and later in San Jose, California. In the latter city he became a U.S. citizen. After graduating from Stanford University and San Francisco Theological Seminary, he served as pastor of Presbyterian churches in Berkeley, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Sacramento. He organized Trinity Community Presbyterian Church of North Hollywood and remained its pastor for 16 years. After retirement in 1965, he served five churches in California and Nevada as interim pastor. He has held many important positions in his church, including moderator and chairman of Christian education. In Sacramento he began a television program in 1962, Capitol and Clergy, which has continued under the guidance of others.\n\nIn 1970 he began a “retirement” service as assistant pastor at the Roseville, California, Presbyterian Church, where his specialty is the needs of the sick and the elderly. It was here that most of his more than 50 hymns were written. Fifteen of them have been selected as winners in the Hymn Society of America new-hymn searches. The quality of his poetry has begun to be recognized, as a number of hymnal editors have chosen to include his work in contemporary books.\n\nThis hymn text was first published by the Hymn Society of America in 1961 in Ten New Stewardship Hymns, with the first line “As men of old their firstfruits brought.” Regarding its writing, the author states: “As pastor of two new churches, with small memberships and great financial needs, I have been deeply concerned with stewardship; I am deeply concerned about missions and the outreach of the church to ‘all the world’; also, stewardship is a very important phase of the Christian life. No one is deeply Christian until he is a good steward.”\n\nIn this and several other stewardship hymns in this section, it should be noted that good stewardship involves, besides money, offering of talents, time, labor, love – yes, of our very selves-to God in the service of those in need.\n\nThe tune REGWALL, by Leland B. Sateren (1913-; see SDAH 407) was published in 1963 by Augsburg Publishing House as an anthem with this hymn as the text. It also found a place in Lutheran Book of Worship, 1978. The composer says REGWALL is an acronym formed by the first three letters of the Christian names of his father and mother: Lawrence and Gertrude, the letters being reversed and a second / added. Sateren also arranged SDAH 407, THE ASH GROVE.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "historicalContext": "Henry Alford (1810-1871; see SDAH 433) wrote this hymn of four stanzas and included it in his Psalms and Hymns, 1844. He increased the number of stanzas to seven in a revision in 1867, then reduced them, and after several revisions of his text by other hands, announced his final version of four stanzas, which appeared in his Poetical Works, 1868. The SDAH hymn is substantially his original text, with a slight change in stanza 3, lines 3 and 4, which were:\n\nFrom His field shall in that day. All offenses purge away.\n\nThe hymn is based on two different parables of Jesus, the wheat and the tares (Matt. 13:24-30) and the seed growing secretly (Mark 4:26-29).\n\nThe tune ST. GEORGE’S, WINDSOR was composed for the hymn “Hark! the Song of Jubilee” and appeared in Thorne’s A Selection of Psalm and Hymn Tunes, 1858. George Job Elvey (1816-1893; see SDAH 223) was the organist at St. George’s Chapel, Windsor, for 47 years; he named his tune to commemorate this church. Elvey also composed DIADEMATA, used for SDAH 223 and 616.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "Fred Pratt Green (1903-; see Biographies), English Methodist minister, wrote this hymn at the suggestion of John Wilson (see SDAH 397), who was impressed with Jackson’s fine tune EAST ACKLAM and wanted a new hymn on a harvest theme.\n\nFirst published in the Methodist Recorder (England) in 1970, it carried a note giving permission for the hymn to be used upon application to Fred Pratt Green. In a short time 125 requests flowed in from all over the British Isles. Now it has found its way into hymnbooks around the world and has been sung in Westminster Abbey.\n\nConcerning the composition of the tune, Francis Jackson writes from his home in York, England: “The actual history of the tune is slightly amusing. I wrote four [tunes] for the hymn ‘God That Made the Earth and Heave [SDAH 47], because I did not like the idea of using the tune AR HYD Y NOS. By a lucky chance [EAST ACKLAM] came to the notice of Francis Westbrook, who included it in Hymns and Songs [the Methodist Hymnal supplement] to the words ‘Through the Love of God Our Savior.’ Henna caught the attention of [John Wilson and] Fred Pratt Green, who wrote the words ‘For the Fruits of His Creation.’ By a curious quirk the recently published Scottish Hymnal includes the words ‘For the Fruits of His Creation’ but set to the tune AR HYD Y NOS!”\n\nJackson goes on to tell how he wrote this tune originally with five notes in a bar. After he revised it to the more conventional four notes to a bar, it became a winner.\n\nThe tune gets its name ACKLAM (the EAST part is seldom used today), from a very small village of about 40 houses on the Wolds, 15 miles from York and six miles from Jackson’s native Malton. “It is in the midst of farming country,” he says, “and has been our escape for nearly 30 years (in our seventeenth-century stone cottage), but is now our permanent main home and greatly appreciated. I have used the ‘EAST’ for the hymn tune name to distinguish it from another, less attractive Acklam, which is a suburb of industrial Middlesbrough. I have recently composed an organ prelude on the tune, and it should be published next year [1985], along with four others.”\n\nFrancis Jackson was born October 2, 1917, at Malton, Yorkshire, England, and was a chorister in the magnificent York Cathedral under the organist, Sir Edward Bairstow. In 1937, at age 20, he gained the Fellowship of the Royal College of Organists with the Limpus Prize for the highest marks for tests at the organ. In the same year he graduated with a B. Mus. at Durham University, and 20 years later earned the D.Mus. From 1933 1940 he was organist at Malton Parish church, and he succeeded Bairstow as organist at York Cathedral in 1946. He stayed there until retirement at age 65 in 1982. For more than 30 years he was conductor of England’s oldest established choral society, the York Musical Society, founded 1765.\n\nAs an organ recitalist, he has toured many countries of the world; he has toured Canada and the United States six times. Compositions include a symphony and an overture for orchestra (he also conducted the York Symphony); several melodramas; part songs, solos, church anthems, and organ works. In 1970 he was made a Fellow of Westminster Choir College, Princeton, New Jersey, and a Fellow of the Royal School of Church Music in England. In 1982, at retirement, he was made a Fellow of the Royal Northern College of Music, a Doctor of York University, and had conferred on him the order of Saint William of York by Archbishop Lord Blanch. He also holds the title, OBE-Officer of the Order of the British Empire.\n\nHis tune is a beautiful example of what a master composer can do with the simplest of materials—in this case, an upward-moving diatonic scale.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "This hymn is a translation by Catherine Winkworth (1827-1878; see Biographies) of a German hymn written by Martin Rinkart. It appears in his Jesu Herz-Büchlein (Booklet of the Heart of Jesus) 1663 edition. Seeing that the words and tune are in Johann Crüger’s Praxis, 1647, it is reasonable to assume that the text was also in Rinkart’s first edition, 1636, and that it was written in or before that year. It is entitled “Tisch-Gebetlein” (A Short Grace at Table). The first two stanzas were the grace or thanksgiving to be sung by his family after meals; the doxology of the third stanza was added about 1636. The hymn is based on some verses in the Apocrypha, Ecclesiasticus 50:22-24. “Now bless ye the God of all, which everywhere doeth great things. May He grant us joyfulness of heart, and that peace may be in our days for the days of eternity” (RV). A similar thought is found in Psalm 126:2, 3.\n\nRinkart was born April 23, 1586, at Eilenburg, near Leipzig. He studied at the University of Leipzig to prepare for the ministry. He taught in the secondary school at Eisleben in 1610; then was choir director in the Church of St. Anne; then for about four years was pastor of two small village churches nearby. In 1617 he was invited to his hometown and was pastor of the Lutheran church there for 32 years until his death. His pastorate covered a walled town, attracted many refugees, which caused abnormal overcrowding the town, and Rinkart had the unhappy experience of conducting the funeral service of two resident and two refugee clergymen. This left him the added burden of being the only minister to conduct the increasing number of burials, up to 40 a day at times. His wife also succumbed to the plague, and he himself fell ill, but survived. In view of all these problems his hymn of praise is a remarkable statement of faith. He died December 8, 1649.\n\nThe translation is in Catherine Winkworth’s (1827-1878; see Biogra- phies) Lyra Germanica, Second Series, 1858. It is titled “The Chorus of God’s Thankful Children” and has the footnote “Martin Rinkart, 1656.” The hymn has been made even more popular by its inclusion by Mendelssohn in his oratorio Hymn of Praise, 1840. The hymn was sung in all the churches as a hymn of thanksgiving for the end of the Thirty Years’ War, a Catholic- Protestant conflict, but it appears to be a coincidence that the elector of Saxony should have selected the verses in the Apocrypha to be used by preachers in their service of thanksgiving, thus giving rise to the false idea that Rinkart wrote the hymn specially for the celebration of the peace.\n\nNUN DANKET, named for the first two words of the German text, was written in 1647 by Johann Crüger (1598-1662; see SDAH 239) and in his collection Praxis Pietatis Melica.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "This text was first written for this tune by Katherine K. Davis (1892-1980; see SDAH 129) in the 1920s under her nom de plans of John Cowley. It was published by E. C. Schirmer Music Company, Boston, in 1939, as anthem No. 1770. Her creative arrangement and the descant have made it a universal favorite of church choirs everywhere.\n\nTHE ASH GROVE is an engaging Welsh melody that uses the separate notes of the three major chords almost in arpeggio form, producing a result that is enjoyable and easy to sing. As her source of the tune, Katherine Davis credits a pamphlet titled Book of National Songs, published by Novello. It is an old Welsh song of two stanzas that tells of the lament (although the melody sounds like a cheerful one!) of a lover for his sweetheart who “sleeps neath the green turf down by the ash grove.” The tune has four long double phrases of 23 syllables each, the first, second, and fourth being identical, and the third phrase ending with a change of key to the dominant. This is not an unusual pattern, and with the frequent four-note scale passages, both ascending and descending, the melody is very easy to learn and sing, even after a first hearing.\n\nThe present arrangement in four-part harmony is by Wayne Hooper (1920-; see Biographies).\n\nFor a unison setting of the same tune, see SDAH 407, “Sent Forth by God’s Blessing.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Claudius wrote no hymns to be sung in church, but several were taken from his poetical works. This one comes from a sketch titled “Paul in north Germany and there singing this so-called “Peasant’s Song.” The Erdmann’s Fest.” The neighbors are represented as coming to Paul’s house 17 stanzas were sung by soloists, and all joined in the chorus, which was a thanksgiving for the harvest. Jane Campbell’s translation, beginning with the third stanza, was published by C. S. Bere in Garland of Song, 1861.\n\nMatthias Claudius, born at Reinfeld, Germany, on August 15, 1740, had an ancestor who latinized his name, Claus Paulsen, to Claudius Pauli, using Claudius as the surname. The son of a Lutheran pastor, Matthias studied for the ministry at University of Jena but changed to courses in law and language. For much of his life he edited a paper at Wandsbeck, near Hamburg, called Wandsbecker Bote (Wandsbeck Messenger); in 1788 he was appointed auditor of the Schleswig-Holstein Bank at Altona. He died at Hamburg on January 21, 1815.\n\nJane Montgomery Campbell was born in 1817 at Paddington, England, the daughter of a Church of England minister. She was a music teacher in the parish school and published some musical exercises titled A Handbook for Singers. She assisted in preparing the above-mentioned Garland of Song and contributed several translations of German hymns and poems to the Children’s Choral Book, 1869. She died at Bovey Tracey, Devonshire on November 15, 1878.de\n\nWIR PFLÜGEN (We Plow) gets its name from the first German words of the third stanza of “Peasant’s Song.” It was first printed in Lieder für Volksschulen (Songs for Elementary Schools), 1800, and it became very popular in German school hymnals. Schulz was given credit for the music in Lindner’s Jugenfreud, 1818. Lowell Mason brought it to the United States in The Seraph, 1840. Even though the melody has a wide compass of an octave and a fifth, it has always been easily sung and appreciated by congregations. Johann Abraham Peter Schulz, the son of a baker, was born March 31, 1747, at Lüneburg, Germany. His father wanted him to be a minister, but he turned instead to music. He left home and studied in Berlin. From 1776 to 1780 he played in, and later directed the French Theater orchestra, Berlin. He moved then to be choir director at Rheinsberg, and then in 1787 to a similar position in Copenhagen, where he stayed for eight years. He was injured trying to save the music library in Copenhagen from a fire and later suffered in a shipwreck in 1796. He died at Schwedt, on the river Oder, northeast of Berlin, on June 10, 1800. He is now known only for this hymn tune, which had its beginning in a secular folk song.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "In 1976 the editor of the Anglican Board of Education wrote to a number of British hymn writers, seeking material for a publication to be called Together for Festivals. Fred Pratt Green (1903-; see Biographies ) sent in two Thanksgiving hymns. This one, titled “The Festival of the First Fruits,” was based on God’s command to the children of Israel to give an offering of the firstfruits found in Deuteronomy 26:2, 3. In addition to singing about being thankful for God’s providence, the final stanza challenges us to be more aware of what we might do to alleviate the hunger in the world.\n\nThe hymn was first sung at the Harvest Festival at St. Mary’s Church in the town of Diss, Norfolk, England, and the author, Pratt Green, was there to preach the sermon. Diss is a distinctive old market town; the church has an imposing array of fifteenth century windows.\n\nHorst Gehann (1928-) was one of the prime movers for, and also supplied a number of hymn tunes (including this one) for, the new Seventh-day Adventist German language hymnal published by the Hamburg Publishing House in the early 1980s. Horst was born at Frankfurt, Germany, and studied biology and music at the Adventist Theological Seminary in Bucharest, Romania. He became an accomplished concert organist, conductor, and composer. From 1973 to 1983 he taught music at the German Adventist Theological Seminary, Marienhohe, Darmstadt.\n\nThe tune name LEBENDIGE GEMEINDE means “living church.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

It was prepared by Edith Lovell Thomas for her book The Whole World Singing, 1950, which was an assembly of songs from more than 40 countries of the world. This canon, or round, comes from the Alsatian part of Germany, which lies between the Rhine River and the Vosges Mountains.\n\nEdith Lovell Thomas was born September 11, 1878, in Eastford, Connecticut, into a Methodist minister’s family of nine. Both father and mother had beautiful voices, and the great hymns were sung and memorized in regular family worship. She began the study of piano at age 12, and then received a scholarship to the Friends (Quaker) School in Providence, Rhode Island. Her first church music job was in her father’s church, playing the organ and directing a “choir” of four. She received her master’s degree and then was a music teacher at Boston University from 1918 to 1931. She also served as minister of music and director of children’s choirs for various churches in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. Her book, Singing Worship for Boys and Girls, has sold more than 250,000 copies. Her other books include Martin and Judy Songs; Sing, Children Sing; and Music in Christian Education. For a time she studied organ with Clarence Dickinson while he was organist-choirmaster at Brick Presbyterian Church in New York. Always intensely interested in hymns and good hymn singing, she served as a judge for several of the Hymn Society of America contests. In retirement at Pilgrim Place, Claremont, California, she continued to work with juniors in preparing music for worship. She died March 16, 1969 at Claremont.\n\nThis canon in three parts can be sung a cappella, or use the accompaniment by Melvin West (1930-; see Biographies), repeating any four-bar phrase for the duration of the canon.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Folliott Sandford Pierpoint was out walking near his native city of Bath, spring, and violets and primroses were in full bloom. As he rested and Somerset, England, and stopped to rest at the top of a hill. It was late surveyed the beauty of the scene and meditated, his thoughts were filled with the manifold gifts of God. Several years later he summarized these thoughts in a hymn written specially for the Communion service, and entitled “The Sacrifice of Praise.” It was first published in Orby by Shipley’s Lyra Eucharista, 1864, in eight stanzas. SDAH’s third stanza is not one of these.\n\nPierpoint was born in Bath, Somerset, England, on October 7, 1835. He was educated at Bath Grammar School, and gained his Bachelor of Arts at I He Cambridge in 1857. He taught classics at Somersetshire College, and later moved to Babbacombe in south Devon, where he lived on a private income supplemented by occasional teaching. He published three volumes of poems and wrote several hymns. He died at Newport, Monmouthshire, on March 10, 1917.\n\nThe tune DIX derives its name from the fact that it was used for the hymn, “As With Gladness Men of Old,” written by William Dix (see SDAH 123). It was published in 1838 in a collection of hymns by Conrad Kocher (1786-1872; see SDAH 123).

Educated at Mill Hill School and New College, Oxford, he graduated with a B.A. in 1948, and became a member of Mansfield College. He was ordained to the Congregational ministry the next year at Oundle, Northamptonshire, and served for a time as pastor at Banstead, Surrey. A distinguished minister-musician, he edited the music for The Golden Book of Nursery Rhymes, 1951, and contributed eight texts and 14 tunes to New Church Praise, 1975, a hymnal supplement for The United Reformed Church in England (a 1972 merger of the Presbyterian and Congregational churches).\n\nIn this simple little “Thank You” hymn, Micklem is not afraid to experiment with conventional materials. Notice that this music is in sparse music sing. The three-part harmony, yet there is no feeling that anything is rhythm goes along freely with the text, sometimes three quarter notes in a bar, sometimes two-which is why the time signature is omitted. (This policy was followed throughout SDAH, that is, if several kinds of meter were used in the hymn, the committee thought it better to allow the note values to dictate the movement, and not have a metrical signature.)\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "These words were inspired by a simple sentence prayed by an elderly woman at a prayer meeting in the early 1900s. Instead of asking blessings from the Lord, she gave herself as a living sacrifice in the words “It doesn’t matter what You bring into our lives, Lord. Just have Your own way with us.” Adelaide Pollard was present in the meeting and the clause “Have Thine Own Way” rang in her ears so intensely that before she reached home she had formed some stanzas of this hymn in her mind. Before retiring that evening, she had completed the hymn. The text and tune first appeared in Northfield Hymnal with Alexander’s Supplement, 1907, compiled by George C. Stebbins.\n\nSarah Addison Pollard was born on November 27, 1862, at Bloomfield, Iowa. She took her education in that state and in Indiana, and then at the Boston School of Oratory. She taught in Chicago in girls’ schools, and then at the Missionary Training School in New York City for eight years. She was also an itinerant Bible teacher and lecturer, both before and after spending a few months in Africa prior to World War I. She spent her last years in the eastern United States, lecturing and teaching. A diabetic, she suffered ill health all her life. After promising but frustrating visits to faith healers, she accepted her handicap and turned to hymn writing, producing several other hymns. In her youth she was nicknamed Addie, from her second Christian name. At the age of 17 she dropped the Sarah and adopted the name Adelaide. On December 20, 1934, while waiting at the railway station in New York, planning to board a train for Philadelphia, she died of a heart attack.\n\nGeorge Coles Stebbins (1846-1945; see Biographies) composed the tune ADELAIDE for these words in 1907. The tune is sometimes called STEBBINS.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "historicalContext": "George Matheson (1842-1906; see SDAH 76) wrote these words at Songs, 1890, under the title “Christian Freedom. Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ.” The apostle Paul describes himself as “I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ” (Eph. 3:1), whereas he was really the prisoner of Nero, the Roman emperor. This serves to emphasize the many remarkable paradoxes and contrasts in the hymn, for example: captive-free; render up Sword-conqueror; sink-stand; imprison-strong; weak-master; sure- varies; freely-chain; enslave-reign; my throne-crown resign; stands-leant. All these contrasts show the spiritual freedom of the Christian when he has become the slave of Jesus Christ.\n\nThe tune LEOMINSTER comes from “The Pilgrim Song,” composed in 1862 by George W. Martin. Martin was born in London on March 8, 1828. He popularized good music, and trained children’s choirs. He was a chorister at St. Paul’s Cathedral and taught music to trainees in Battersea. He was church organist and also director of the National Choral Society. He Composed glees, madrigals, and part songs. Unfortunately, he became an alcoholic, and died in a hospital at Wandsworth, London, on April 16, 1881. The tune was arranged by Arthur Seymour Sullivan (1842-1900; see SDAH 169).\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

She was interrupted by one prisoner who exclaimed, “Good Lord, don’t pass me by.” William Howard Doane (1832-1915; see Biographies), who had composed many tunes for Crosby’s words, suggested a hymn with the title “Pass Me Not, O Gentle Savior.” She thought about the incident and its spiritual overtones and wrote the words of this hymn, making it a real prayer from the heart. Being blind herself, she could easily understand the feelings of the blind beggar whose story is the basis of the hymn. It was first published in Songs of Devotion, 1870. The tune, composed by Doane in 1870 especially for the words, is one of many gospel songs by this author-composer team.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Hymnologist Leonard Ellinwood says that “this hymn was written c 1880 by Ada Whiddington, about whom nothing is known. It was a favorite at the Keswick Convention, which was held every July international conference in England’s Lake District. Several books have given credit for the text to an A. B. Simpson.” The first appearance in a book was in Ira D. Sankey’s Sacred Songs No. 1, c. 1896, where it was set to a different tune. Fannie Bolton made some changes, and it was included in F. E. Belden’s Christ in Song, 1900.\n\nThe theme of the hymn is extracted from a longer statement by the apostle Paul, “not I, but Christ” (Gal. 2:20). Only as He dwells within us can we reveal Him in word, thought, and action (stanza 1); can we truly sympathize with others (stanza 2); can we really be humble (stanza 3); can we do all things (stanza 4).\n\nFrances (Fannie) Eugenia Bolton (birthdate unknown) was the daughter of a Methodist minister and had literary training at the ladies’ seminary at Evanston, Illinois. She joined the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Chicago when she was a correspondent for a Chicago newspaper. In 1887 she joined the staff of Ellen G. White; her specified duties were to correct any spelling errors or grammatical mistakes and to eliminate repetitions in the manuscripts. Erratic, moody, and changeable, she became dissatisfied and discontented with her job; she asked for time off and studied at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor.\n\nIn late 1891 Ellen G. White’s secretary, Sara McEnterfer, became seriously ill and was unable to accompany Mrs. White on her visit to Australia. Miss Bolton pleaded to go as substitute and was reluctantly accepted. Again she became dissatisfied and complained that she received no credit for “improving” the “faulty” manuscripts she was given to edit. As a result she was dismissed. This cycle was repeated twice more. Finally, Fannie said that she could not do this work; she decided to return to the States and resigned. She later confessed that she was unworthy for the task offered her, and regretted the trouble she had caused. She died at Battle Creek on June 28, 1926, and was buried at Eureka, Michigan.\n\nThe tune BOLTON was composed by Bolton and named later to commemorate her. It is a mixture of 3/4 and 4/4 time, so the committee left off the time signature, allowing the quarter and half notes to have their regular value throughout.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Albert Frederick Bayly (1901-1984; see Biographies) found great during the period from December 1947 to December 1949 he wrote a paraphrase in verse from each of the prophets from Isaiah to Malachi. They were included in his booklet Rejoice, O People, published in 1950. This particular hymn takes the most outstanding verses from the prophet Micah and applies his words from the ancient past to the practical issues of modern times, indeed to January 1949, when the hymn was written. It originally had five stanzas. One slight change has been made in the last stanza, which began “How shall my soul fulfil,” and in the second stanza, whose first line ends “should you not justice know?”\n\nIn 1950 Bayly asked Erik Routley (1917-1982; see SDAH 13) to set hymn to the tune TYES CROSS. However, when the supplement to Hymns some of his hymns, including this one, to music. Routley did so, and set this Ancient and Modern came to be written, titled 100 Hymns for Today, 1969, one of the editors, Sir John Dykes Bower, wrote to Routley saying that he wanted to use both words and music, but that TYES CROSS had one phrase in it that S very much like a phrase in the tune LOVE UNKNOWN (see SDAH 188). He asked Routley if he could adjust the tune; the latter complied willingly and produced the present tune SHARPTHORNE, which he said was “a sort of paraphrase in the minor key” of TYES CROSS. Tyes Cross and Sharpthorne are neighboring hamlets in the county of Sussex, not far from where Routley spent his early childhood.\n\nNotice the different chord that completes stanzas 1 and 2, which means that the melody ends on the tonic, but in major. Routley also wrote SDAH 13, “New Songs of Celebration Render,” and SDAH 356, “All Who Love and Serve Your City.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

He was president of the University of South Dakota, and later became a teacher of history at the University of Chicago, 1892-1896.

    "historicalContext": "Mary Brown, author of this hymn of consecration to service, is thought to have lived in Jewett City, Connecticut, during the last part of the nineteenth century, but nothing more about her is known. In Hymns of Our Faith, 1964, William Reynolds says that stanzas 2 and 3 were written by Charles Edwin Prior, born near Moosup, Connecticut, January 27, 1856. He was a savings bank official in Jewett City, and played the organ and directed music in the Congregational and Baptist churches of that city. Besides writing several songs, he published these collections of Sunday school songs: Spicy Breezes, 1883; Sparkling and Bright, 1890; and Our Best Endeavor, 1892. At Hartford, Connecticut, he served as president of the Baptist Union, and directed the music at the annual meetings of the Baptist Sunday School Union at Crescent Beach. He died at Bridgeport, Connecticut, June 27, 1927.\n\nCarrie Esther Rounsefell, born at Merrimac, New Hampshire, March 1, 1861, was reared in Manchester, New Hampshire. Her husband was a bookkeeper for a paint and wallpaper company. A tiny woman, she traveled all over the northeast as a singing evangelist, accompanying herself on an autoharp. In late life she became a member of the Church of God, and lived in Durham, Maine, where she died September 18, 1930.\n\nDuring a revival meeting in the Baptist church at Lynn, Massachusetts, the pastor gave Rounsefell the first stanza of Mary Brown’s hymn and suggested she write a tune for it. Later she recalled: “I took the words, got down before the Lord with my little autoharp, asked Him to give me a tune, and this music was the answer.” The hymn was sung in the service that evening; later it was printed in a song sheet, and from there it has made its way into many hymnals around the world. Its challenging words served as inspiration for another gospel singer, Homer Rodeheaver, who wrote in his Hymnal Handbook for Standard Gospel Songs, 1931: “One of the very first gospel songs that I ever heard after I left my home in the mountains of east Tennessee was ‘I’ll Go Where You Want Me to Go.’ It was the singing of a boy by a singer named Ellis, in a young people’s meeting at Ohio Wesleyan University, Delaware, Ohio, in 1897, that gave me my first urge to become a gospel singer.” Rodeheaver recalled that “on the golf course in Florida one day, Mr. John D. Rockefeller told me this was one of his favorite songs. He asked me to sing it for a group of folks who had gathered to meet and greet him. He joined and sang the chorus with us.”\n\nIra D. Sankey (see Biographies) tells about his visit to the Battle Creek (Michigan) Sanitarium where “this well-known missionary and consecration hymn was adopted by a class of more than 100 missionary nurses as their class hymn. Every Sunday afternoon they would gather for a social meeting and always sing, ‘I’ll go where Thou would’st I should go, dear Lord’ [possibly the original wording], which they called ‘their hymn.’ In this class were students from nearly every state of the Union, from Australia, South Africa, South America, Bulgaria, Armenia, and nearly all European countries. At the close of the course they agreed that after they had parted and gone to their different fields, they would sing this hymn every Sunday afternoon, as they had done in their happy class days.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Washington Gladden was the editor of the magazine Sunday Afternoon.\n\nIn the March 1879 issue, in a regular column, The Still Hour, he included a poem he had written entitled “Walking With God.” It had three stanzas of eight lines each. It was shortened by Charles H. Richards to a hymn of four stanzas of four lines each, as we now have it. It appeared in his Songs of Christian Praise, 1880. The theme progresses from walking with God to closer company with God, and ultimately to living with God, which was the experience of Enoch.\n\nGladden was born on February 11, 1836, at Potts Grove, Pennsylvania. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1859 and was ordained as a Congregational minister in 1860. He served in the states of New York and Then Massachusetts until 1871, when he turned to journalism for three years. He returned to the ministry and in 1882 was transferred to Columbus, Ohio, where he served as pastor of the First Congregational Church for more than 30 years. He was moderator of the National Council of Congregational Churches from 1904 to 1907, and was the author of 32 books. An outstanding preacher, lecturer, and writer, he promoted the social gospel and attacked political corruption and economic evils. He fostered the closer cooperation of the different churches and popularized biblical criticism. He was given three honorary doctorates, one conferred by the Roman Catholic University of Notre Dame. He died at Columbus, Ohio, on July 2, 1918.\n\nThe tune MARYTON, which Gladden preferred more than any other for his words, was composed by Henry Percy Smith. It appeared in his Church Hymns With Tunes, 1874. It was composed especially for the words of John Keble’s hymn, “Sun of My Soul Thou Savior Dear” (SDAH 502). Smith was born in 1825 on the island of Malta. He graduated from Balliol College, Oxford, with a B.A. in 1848 and an M.A. in 1850. In 1849 he was ordained a deacon in the Anglican Church and in 1850, a priest. His first appointment was to assist the Reverend Charles Kingsley in his parish at Eversley, Hampshire; his next was in 1851 as perpetual curate at Farnborough in the same county. He was vicar at Great Barton in Suffolk from 1868 to 1882, then moved to Cannes in France, where he served as chaplain until 1892. He was appointed canon of Gibraltar Cathedral until he retired to in Hampshire, England, where he died on January 28, 1898.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Bryan Jeffery Leech (1931-; see SDAH 270), a minister of the Evangelical Covenant Church of America, wrote from his home in Santa Barbara, California: “[It] has the tune name BJORKLUND because Clifford Bjorklund, the secretary of our denomination, commissioned me to write a hymn for World Relief Sunday. At first all I could think of was the terrible plight of the needy people, of starving bodies and the ravages of drought, which did not seem suitable subjects for a hymn. And then I thought of what our reaction to such things should be, and immediately the recurring idea of ‘Let Your Heart Be Broken’ was born.”\n\nIt was printed by the Hymn Society of America in The Hymn, April 1976, and in that same year in the hymnal edited by Leech and Fred Bock, Hymns for the Family of God. There the tune bears the name BJORKLUND MAJOR, because it is presented in the key of D major instead of the original D minor. It also has one melody change at the end of line three, but the SDAH committee elected to use the composer’s original version.\n\nEspecially challenging, as we think of our responsibility toward the needs of the world around us, is Leech’s phrase in the fourth stanza: “In the world’s great trouble, risk yourself for God.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Anyone who has awakened to the magic of dew-laden grass and a brilliant sunrise can identify with this expression of joy in the service of the Lord! Geoffrey Anketell Studdert-Kennedy was born September 27, 1883, at Leeds, England. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, and ordained to the ministry in 1908. He served pastorates at Rugby, Leeds and Worcester, and was a much-loved chaplain in the armed forces in World War I. His selfless courage in rescuing wounded soldiers brought a rebuke from his superior officer, and another from the king! He was a great preacher, traveling all over England and the United States to speaking appointments. He was active in the Industrial Christian Fellowship, and the  king appointed him as one of the royal chaplains. A colleague described him as “one of God’s greatest gifts to our generation.” He died as he lived-on his feet, preaching, at Liverpool, England, March 8, 1929.\n\nMORNING SONG gets its name from the text by Isaac Watts carrying that title and beginning “Once more my soul, the rising day.” It appeared with this tune in John Wyeth’s Repository of Sacred Music, Part Second, 1813, under the tune name CONSOLATION. Many tunes in this pioneer songbook were borrowed by other compilers of these Southern tune books with shaped notes. Davisson’s Kentucky Harmony, 1816, gave credit to a Mr. Dean. Some hymnologists think this is a misprint for Elkanah Kelsy Dare (1782-1826), a Methodist preacher from Delaware who is given credit for 13 of the tunes in the Wyeth collection mentioned above. Annabel Morris Buchanan, the noted researcher of American folk songs, has traced this melody to its ancestry in English folk songs and carols.\n\nThe harmonization used here is by Charles Winfred Douglas (1867- 1944; see SDAH 72). Douglas also arranged SDAH 136, IN DULCE JUBILO.\n\nSee SDAH 215 for a unison setting of MORNING SONG by Melvin West.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

Then she taught in the Toronto public schools until retirement in 1973. A member of the Knox Presbyterian Church, Toronto, she has been very active in the work of Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship since it began in Canada. Her published writings include textbooks (Let’s Listen to Music, 1944, and The Creative Classroom, 1958) and several books of devotional prose and poetry. She worked with Donald Hustad in writing lyrics for the cantata Celebration of Discipleship, 1974, and has authored more than 20 hymns, some of which were published by The Hymn Society of America.\n\nHere are her words about the writing of “So Send I You”: “I grew up in an atmosphere where ‘laying all on the altar’ was preached to the nth degree, and the full-orbed glory of the great commission was not declared. Conse- quently, my song was all on one vein, and not really true to the gospel, although I was not aware of this. It was written in 1937 merely as a poem, not a song, and appeared in a religious magazine in 1938 or so. After that, I heard nothing of it for 16 years. Meanwhile, I had moved to another church and grown up spiritually. While I like my little poem, I was by then well aware of its deficiencies. Then suddenly it appeared in John W. Peterson’s (1921- see SDAH 111) setting. He had been sent the words with no name attached. In time I saw it and got in touch with him.”\n\nFrom his home in Paradise Valley, Arizona, Peterson sent this story of how he set her poem to music: “In the summer of 1954, I was on the staff of Moody Bible Institute radio station WMBI, Chicago. One of the girls in the office handed me a poem one day that had impressed her. She thought I could possibly read it on one of the programs I conducted called The Shut-in Hour. The poem was ‘So Send I You.’ I did use it and was deeply moved by the verses, so much so that I tucked them away in my briefcase that I would be carrying to Kansas a few weeks later for a summer vacation. One morning in Wichita, Kansas, while improvising at the piano at the home of my mother, with the lines of this poem before me, the melody came. As I sang it through, I was again deeply moved by the power of the lyrics. I called some of my family who were present to come to the piano and hear the new song. Their reaction was the same as mine. Somehow I sensed in my heart that God s going to use this song. It was first published in Low Voice, one of a group of books called Melody-Aire Series that I produced for Moody Press in 1954.”\n\nAfter this tune was written, Clarkson wrote a second set of words that in a more mature way gave expression to the challenge she found in John 20:21: “Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you. “This new text was published by Singspiration in 1963 and included in the Baptist Hymnal, 1975, the same version SDAH uses. She adapted SDAH 244, “My Song Shall Be of Jesus.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

There is also a footnote stating that it was copyrighted in 1892 and taken from Illustrated Bible Object Lessons and Songs for Little Ones. This book by Lillie Affolter and F. E. Belden, contained 30 songs and hymns written for 52 lessons on the life of Christ and was designed for use by teachers in Sabbath and in Sunday schools.\n\nThe tune, unnamed, is also by Belden, and is somewhat typical of gospel songs for children. It has a pleasant melody, with an alto part either a third or a sixth below it. The other two parts make up a simple harmonic pattern that uses only two or three chords.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

Work (1901-1967; see SDAH 121), written in 1943 and published by Galaxy Music Corporation. Because of the eighth and sixteenth notes in this piece, the tempo should be rather deliberate.\n\nThere are actually four melodic versions of this spiritual. The reason for this phenomenon was the sale of slaves from one plantation to another and the structural and melodic alterations that resulted in the songs they carried with them. One version, lighter in mood and more rhythmic than this one, has been sung and enjoyed especially by young people. After consideration of the three melodies, the hymnal commitee decided to use this one, considered to be the authentic melody, as published by John W. Work, the great Black musician and authority on the spirituals.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "Fred Pratt Green (1903-; see Biographies) wrote this hymn for a stewardship renewal campaign while he was pastor of Trinity Methodist Church in the London borough of Sutton. The phrase “money, talents, time” reminds us that true Christian stewardship involves more than just giving money. Stanzas 1 a 1 and 2 are even more challenging in regard to our responsibility to the world around the church. May the hymns we sing behind the closed doors of the sanctuary never “drug us to forget its needs.” He wrote this at a time when the church was being criticized for its overconcern with its own life and its failure to be involved in the world’s activities. This hymn was actually the beginning of his most successful career as a hymnwriter, at the age of 65!\n\nThe noted British hymnologist John Wilson (see SDAH 397) encouraged Fred to change the third line of the third stanza, which originally read, “Let the world rebuke us by the way it gives,” to “Lord, reprove, inspire us by the Way You give.” Since the initial publication in Hymns and Songs, it has been widely used around the world in many denominational hymn books.\n\nThe words are an echo of the practical Christianity described in James 1:22, “But be doers of the word, and not hearers only,” and 1 John 3:18, “Let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.”\n\nThe Episcopal Church of America was the first to wed this text to Ralph Vaughan Williams’ (1872-1958; see Biographies) folk song-like tune KING’S WESTON, which SDAH uses again at No. 232, “At the Name of Jesus.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "It was Pentecost Sunday in 1969. Brian Wren (1936-; see Biographies) was the pastor of a Congregational church in Hockley, Essex, England. In the hymn book the church was using, there were no hymns that showed the Holy Spirit “living, working in our world,” no hymns about the influence of the Holy Spirit on history, or on any event outside the church and the individual person. So he wrote this hymn for that purpose, hoping it would be singable, enjoyable, and easy. He says, “I wrote it in a simple structure, with the alternating repetition of two choruses, a device I borrowed from Isaac Watts’s hymn ‘Give to Our God Immortal Praise’ [SDAH 106]. (referring to the last half of each stanza as a chorus)”\n\nBecause of the hymn’s emphasis on feeding the hungry, setting things right, and love “working in our world,” it is placed in the Loving Service section. Obviously, it can also be used in the section on the Holy Spirit.\n\nJohn Wilson (1905-; see SDAH 397) composed LAUDS in 1969 for the hymn text “Songs of Praise the Angels Sang.” It first appeared in the book Hymns and Songs. But married to Wren’s text, it seems to express perfectly the joyful affirmation the author intended.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "The first lines of the third stanza give us the reason why this hymn was Theeded: “Where generation, class, or race divides us to our shame.” Brian Wren (1936-; see Biographies) was pastor of the Congregational church in Hockley, Essex, England, in 1970 when a controversy arose involving the generation gap. He wrote seven stanzas in the original poem but cut it to the present four before using it. Actually, the message of the hymn was so pointed that he feared to use it at the time, waiting instead until the furor died down and the people could be united again in their praise.\n\nST. BOTOLPH is the name of the Anglican church in Boston, England, the tower of which is known as the “Boston Stump” and whose musical excellence and Christian community were a source of inspiration to Brian Wren. The tune was composed by Gordon Slater in 1929 and first published in Songs of Praise for Boys and Girls with the text “Dear Father, Keep Me Through This Day.” It was also sometimes used with “Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee” (see SDAH 241).\n\nGordon Archibold Slater was born March 1, 1896, at Harrogate, Yorkshire. He studied music at York Minster under E. C. Bairstow. After a three-year term of service in France in the armed forces in World War I (1916-1919), he held various minor posts until 1927, when he was appointed organist at Leicester Cathedral, where he founded and conducted the Leicester Bach Choir. In 1930 he became organist and master of the choristers at Lincoln Cathedral, retaining this position until 1966. He was appointed vice president of the Friends of Lincoln Cathedral in 1970 and president of the Boston Choral Society in 1973. His compositions include piano and organ music, hymns, anthems, and songs. He was awarded the OBE (Order of the British Empire) in 1974 and died in Lincoln on January 26, 1979.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

It was for prolific contemporary hymn writers, wrote this one at the request of the occasion of the reopening of their church as a flexible working space. They wanted the hymn to emphasize the integration of people of diverse cultures and outlooks. It was sung there in 1980 to the tune TYROL, and in 1982 was included as a poem in The Hymns and Ballads of Fred Pratt Green, Hope Publishing. The original has three eight-line stanzas, the SDAH hymn consisting of only the first. The hymn echoes Galatians 3:28: “There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.”\n\nFor a long time, JEG ER SAA GLAD (I am so glad) was thought to be a German or Norwegian folk song. Also known as CHRISTMAS EVE because of its association with the first lines of the text “I Am So Glad Each Christmas Eve,” it was written by Peter Knudsen, born in 1819, the son of a parish singer in Voga, Norway. While still very young, he showed musical talent and was accepted in the Premilitary Musical Organization in Oslo. After study of the violin and several other instruments, he became choir director at Holinestraud. In 1854 he was appointed civic music director and school music administrator in Krager, where he organized Midsummer Eve music festivals. Moving to Olesund, he spent the next four years as organist/ choirmaster at the church there, during which time he composed this delightful tune. He died just before Christmas in 1863.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "historicalContext": "In 1908 the London Missionary Society sponsored a pageant to depict the triumphs of missionary work. The society hired the large Agricultural Hall in Islington, north London, for the display. The month-long exhibition was named “The Orient in London,” and the Reverend Dugald Macfadyen was in charge. He asked his uncle, William Arthur Dunkerley, John Oxenham, which he took from a character in Charles Kingsley’s to write the libretto for the pageant. Dunkerley adopted the pen name of novel Westward Ho! Under this name he wrote the words of this hymn for the exhibition. It reflects his strong feeling against sectarianism. Incidentally, young Winston Churchill opened the pageant. The theme of the hymn reflects the apostle Paul’s statement: “There is neither Jew nor ye are all one in Christ Jesus” (Gal. 3:28). The hymn was first published in Oxenham’s Bees in Amber, 1913.\n\nDunkerley was born in Cheetham, Manchester, England, on November 12, 1852, and educated at Victoria University in that city. After graduation he worked for his father in his business as a wholesale provision merchant. After five years in the business, he married and went to New York to start a branch there. He was interested in journalism, and on his return to England in 1881 he started two magazines. His writing was so successful that he his whole time to it. In his journalistic career he wrote more than 40 novels and 20 volumes of prose and poetry. Much of his writing was religious, on the life of Christ; he taught a Bible class in Ealing after he moved there in 1913. He was a member of the Congregational Church but was very interested in Roman Catholicism. He died at High Salvington, Worthing, Sussex, in January 1941.\n\nThe tune ST. PETER was composed by Alexander Robert Reinagle (1799-1877; see also SDAH 238 for a lower key).\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "From her home in Seattle, Washington, Olive Spannaus writes: “The hymn text was written for the Lutheran Human Relations Association of America early in 1960. The first stanza practically wrote itself. The lines came to me in the midst of my housework, and I quickly picked up a pencil to write them down. The rest of the hymn was done by snatches, and before too long, I knew I was writing the hymn for the LHRA, a group that my husband and I actively support. I sent it to them with a note that I hoped they would have some use for it. ‘If not,’ said the covering letter, ‘then I at least shall have had the fun of writing it.”\n\nThey did have use for it, and sang it at the Annual Institute on Human Relations at Valparaiso University in 1960. Each year since then it has been sung at the banquet of the annual institute. In 1965 the hymn came to the attention of the Commission on Worship of the Lutheran Church, Missouri Synod, which published it in the Worship Supplement to their Lutheran Hymnal, where it was set to the tune BEATUS VIR. The author has twice made revisions of the text. Sensing the need for male-female inclusive language, she made slight alterations in stanzas one and two. She has firmly declined permission to change all singular (I, me) constructions to plural (we, us), saying, “Personal relations are and ought to be personal, and therefore individual concern and responsibility!”\n\nMost of the thoughts are taken directly from Philippians 2:1-8, which love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, fulfil ye my begins: “If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of Joy, that ye be like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind” (verses 1, 2).\n\nBorn January 23, 1916, in St. Louis, Missouri, Olive Wise Spannaus was educated in the public schools and attended Brown’s Business College, where her father was principal. She majored in English and Latin at Washington University, St. Louis; her first employment was as a secretary at Ward Junior High School in University City, Missouri. Married in 1939 to R. E. Spannaus, a graduate of Concordia Seminary (Lutheran), she assisted him in parish ministry in El Monte and Livingston, California, and in Lutheran Child and Family Services in Chicago, Washington, and Seattle. In addition to being a busy wife and mother of four children, Spannaus has served in a number of leadership roles: the first woman elected to the board of directors of the English District of the Lutheran Church, Missouri Synod; member of the LCMS Task Force on Women (1973-1977); offices at various levels of the Lutheran Women’s Missionary League and the League of Women Voters; and many other church and community organizations. In 1973 she co-authored The Spirit and Me, a series of mini studies from the Bible, and with her husband, authored The Total Woman Versus the Shalom Woman, a comparison of the two books and philosophies. She has written several other published hymn texts and a group of original folk hymns that she uses in her song programs, accompanying herself on the autoharp.\n\nFor notes on Frederick C. Maker (1844-1927), the composer of the tune MELROSE, see SDAH 303, ST. CHRISTOPHER. He also wrote the tune REST, SDAH 481.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "historicalContext": "This hymn is a paraphrase of the “love chapter,” 1 Corinthians 13: “Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing” (verses 1, 2). Christopher Wordsworth (1807-1885; see on SDAH 145) was the nephew of the great poet laureate William Wordsworth. He also wrote SDAH 382 and 383, “O Day of Rest and Gladness.”\n\nGUILDFORD CATHEDRAL is one of several hymn tunes SDAH has that can be sung as a canon (see Index of Canons [or Rounds], on SDAH, P. 808). In this one, the melody is repeated in the tenor part after a two-beat delay.\n\nFrom his home in West Kensington, London, England, William “Bill” Ives (Grayston is a pen name) writes: “The background to this tune is fairly simple. In 1977 I wrote a 45-minute sequence of words and music on a Whitsuntide theme entitled ‘Tongues of Fire. While the whole work has not yet appeared in print, two items from it have. One is an anthem, ‘Listen, Sweet Dove,’ and the other is this tune, GUILDFORD CATHEDRAL, so named because I was a member of the choir there from 1971 to 1976 and have many happy memories of my time there. I wanted to write a simple canon that would be as disguised as possible.”\n\nIves was born in England in 1948 and spent his early years as a boy chorister at Ely Cathedral. Later he went to Cambridge University as a choral exhibitioner and studied for a music degree. After some years in the teaching profession, he joined The King’s Singers as a tenor. This is an ensemble of six men who have become famous in Europe and America for their concerts of music in all styles, achieving a high standard of excellence in both a cappella and accompanied singing. They have made a score of highly esteemed recordings and have more than a thousand songs in their repertoire. At the beginning of 1986, Ives left the group in order to pursue other musical interests, mainly as composer and arranger. As a lifelong singer, most of his work has been vocal, much of it sacred, and he has a number of published works to his credit. As a choral clinician, he is involved in work at the Royal School of Church Music; in 1987 he visited Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia to conduct workshops.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "At one of Dwight L. Moody’s evangelistic meetings in Brockton, Massachusetts, a young man stood and gave his testimony with these words: I am going to trust, and I am going to obey.” Daniel Brink Towner (1850-1919), who was a soloist at the meeting, was impressed by these words. He jotted them down and sent them with the story of the incident to John H. Sammis. The latter wrote the words of the refrain first, then added the five stanzas and sent them to Towner. The words of the refrain summarize the thrust of the whole hymn, which first appeared in Hymns Old and New, 1887.\n\nSammis was born in Brooklyn, New York, on July 6, 1846. He became a successful businessman in Logansport, Indiana, as well as an active layman in the church. He gave up his business career to become the secretary of the YMCA, and later felt the urge to become a minister. He followed the call, completed a study course, and in 1880 was ordained to the Presbyterian ministry. He served in Iowa, Indiana, Michigan, and Missouri, and then in 1901 transferred to California. He taught in the Los Angeles Bible Institute until his death on June 12, 1919.\n\nTowner composed the tune, a typical gospel song tune, employing just three chords, with the exception of a change of key in the refrain. Towner also contributed two other tunes to SDAH, all unnamed: No. 109 to the words “Marvelous Grace” and No. 508 to the words “Anywhere With Jesus,” the tune sometimes called SECURITY.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Published in John Bowring’s Hymns, 1825, this hymn is based on Isaiah 21:11, 12. It is a dialogue, and can be sung antiphonally-scores 1 and 3 are sung by the traveler, and scores 2 and 4 by the watchman on the wall. The imagery here is that the darkness of night suggests trouble and the ascension of the Daystar, the “Sun of Righteousness” brings the hope that comes with the brightness of the morning.\n\nOn Sir John Bowring (1792-1872), see SDAH 237.\n\nABERYSTWYTH is named after the town on the coast of Wales where the composer was a university professor of music. He wrote it for a Welsh hymn and later matched it with Wesley’s “Jesus, Lover of My Soul” at the end of his cantata Ceridwen. Ever since, the tune has been the favorite in British countries for that hymn.\n\nJoseph Parry was born May 24, 1841, at Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, into a poor family. By the time he was 10, he had to work in the puddling furnaces of the iron foundry. In 1854 the family moved to Danville, Pennsylvania, where he studied music in a class with other ironworkers. After he won a prize for composition, his fellow workers raised a fund to send him to college at Genesco, New York. In 1862 he returned to Wales and won prizes in competition at the Eisteddfodau (music festivals) in several cities. After some organ concerts in the United States to raise money, he attended the Royal Academy of Music, London, and received the D.Mus. at Cambridge in 1878. Back at Danville in America, he taught music for two years, then was recalled to Wales to be professor of music at University College, Aberystwyth. Later he held the same position at University College, Cardiff, Wales. One of Wales’ most distinguished musicians, Parry wrote operas, two oratorios, cantatas, songs, instrumental music, and 400 hymn tunes. This is the only one that is still in wide use. He died February 17, 1903, at Penarth near Cardiff.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

A self-taught organist and pianist, she assisted her Methodist evangelist husband in his ministry. Their devotional radiobroadcast A Visit With the Joneses, begun in 1948 direct from their home, also featured their five children, three of whom became ordained ministers. This program was continued by their son, Rev. Bert. L. Jones, who gave this story:\n\n“Mother wrote this song during the dark days of World War II with the words of 2 Timothy 3:1 in mind: This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.’ The song was written in our family home in the Dormont area of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Inspiration for the words and music came spontaneously as she was in the middle of her housework actually, while she was ironing. She took a pad of paper from her apron pocket and jotted down the words, melody, and harmony. When I came home from high school that day, Mother said, “Bert, you must try a new song that the Lord gave me today.” As I played the song for the first time, and our family group sang it several times, we never dreamed how far the song would go to bless so many people.\n\n“It has been frequently used in the Billy Graham crusades. A very special high point for Mother came on the closing day of the crusade at Columbus, Ohio, when George Beverly Shea (see SDAH 75) asked her to sit on the platform, and he introduced her to the crowd before singing the song.” She August 18, 1972, at Erie, Pennsylvania.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "These words were written by an anonymous Christian who was evidently a fervent believer in the imminent second advent of Jesus Christ. The hymn’s occurrence in America was in Advent Hymn Book. Designed for the Use of Those Who Look for and Love the Appearing of Jesus Christ. It was compiled by S. J. Varney and printed at Lowell, Massachusetts, in 1854. The Advent Christians used it in their 1894 hymnbook, and since then it has appeared only in SDA hymnals.\n\nThe title of the hymn, which is mentioned in the stanza, is taken from James 2:5. The hymn pictures a pilgrim who is on the way to meet the chariot of the king but falls asleep, unarmed and unprepared. The challenge is to look beyond the external problems and fears, which are signs that the king is near, and to sing in prospect of the bright future.\n\nThe tune RODMAN was composed by Lowell Mason (1792-1872; see Biographies). Even though it is in the simple gospel song style, as with Mason’s tunes almost without exception, there is no refrain.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "This hymn, based on the prophecy of Daniel in his interpretation of the dream given to King Nebuchadnezzar, is virtually a Bible study in verse. It was composed by Franklin Edson Belden (1858-1945; see Biographies) and appeared in Hymns and Tunes, 1886. Four scriptures were listed at the head of the hymn, namely: Deuteronomy 29:29; Amos 3:7; 2 Peter 1:21; Daniel 2:28. Below the hymn was the title “The Four Universal Kingdoms,” and then Daniel’s description of the dream, which the king had forgotten, as given in Daniel 2:31-36. Under the heading “Interpretation of the Dream” verses 37 to 40 and 42 to 44 were quoted, with occasional remarks in parentheses to identify the kingdoms mentioned. The hymn follows this interpretation, giving a succinct summary of world history from Assyria (or Babylon) to the future establishment of Christ’s everlasting kingdom. The notes under the hymn show that the “smiting of the image” cannot refer to the first advent of Christ as a babe, but to the Second Advent, when He comes in glory as King of kings. The note ends: “The ‘smiting’ results in total destruction and annihilation of all earthly kingdoms, which will occur at the second coming of Christ.”\n\nThe tune, unnamed, was also composed by Franklin Belden.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "These words are a paraphrase by Philip Doddridge of three verses in the New Testament: Luke 12:35-37. There is one omitted stanza.\n\nThe hymn appears in Job Orton’s Hymns Founded on Various Texts in the Holy Scriptures, published in 1755 after Doddridge’s death and containing most of his hymns. It was Doddridge’s common practice to write a hymn that contained the main thought or a summary of his sermon, and then have the congregation sing it as a closing hymn. In those days when many people were illiterate, hymns were sung by the “lining-out” method. A reader would read out the first line of a stanza, and then the congregation would sing it. Then he would read out the second line, which would be sung, and so on, line by line. While this may seem to destroy the continuity of thought, when done properly it is quite rhythmic. It did enable those who could not read to join in the singing of a hymn, new or old, and the words would reinforce the sermon that had just been delivered.\n\nBorn in London on June 26, 1702, Philip Doddridge was a weak and sickly child, the twentieth in the family. His mother was the daughter of a Lutheran minister who had fled from Bohemia to England because of religious persecution, and she brought Philip up as a Nonconformist. His father was the son of a Church of England clergyman who had resigned his living rather than subscribe to the Act of Uniformity, which required obedience to the Anglican prayer book in its entirety.\n\nWhile still a child, Doddridge lost both his parents and was cared for by friends. He showed signs of academic ability and religious devotion, and was therefore offered an education to train for the Anglican ministry. However, the university statutes, which required acceptance of the Thirty-nine Articles of the Anglican faith, were unacceptable to his inbred and cultivated Independent-or Congregational-theological principles. So he declined the offer and trained instead at Kibworth in Leicestershire for the ministry of the Independent Church. In 1723 he completed the course and succeeded his teacher, Jennings, at Kibworth. Six years later he was chosen to conduct a new academy being established at Market Harborough, but he was transferred in the same year to Northampton. He was appointed to the Castle Hill church and directed the theological seminary for 22 years, training many other young men in philosophy and theology for the Congregational ministry. The University of Aberdeen awarded him the honorary D.D. degree in 1736. His health was never very good, and in 1751 he was persuaded to make a journey to Lisbon to find a cure, but he died there of tuberculosis on October 26, 1751. He was cofounder of the hospital in Northampton. In that town there stands to his memory the Doddridge Memorial Chapel. He wrote almost 400 hymns, most of them based on his sincere, practical sermons. He also wrote SDAH 611, “Awake, My Soul!”\n\nGARELOCHSIDE, first published in Christian Praise (1957), was composed by Kenneth George Finlay. Born February 3, 1882, in Marylebone, Middlesex, England, the son of an Aberdeen University professor, he was educated there and later at Edinburgh. A naval architect, he held responsible positions in shipbuilding before deciding in 1928 to devote himself to music. He studied under Ralph Vaughan Williams (see Biographies) at the Royal College of Music for one year, and then another year in Glasgow, Scotland. From 1930 to 1947 he was a teacher of class singing at the Royal Academy at Irvine in Ayrshire. Finlay wrote about 40 hymn tunes, two cantatas, part songs, and choral and instrumental pieces. He retired in 1947 to Kent to be with his sister, eventually moving to Glasgow, in 1957, where he died at age 92 on April 15, 1974. The tune name recalls scenery he must have been familiar with, for Gareloch is an inlet of the Firth of Clyde, less than 28 miles from Glasgow. One distinctive feature of the tune is its almost complete descending octave in the final phrase.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "Watching for the Lord to come is the subject of this hymn, based on Jesus’ parable of the 10 virgins, recorded in Matthew 25:1-7. It was first published by Laurentius Laurenti in his Evangelica Melodica, 1700, a collection of words and music for the entire Christian church year.\n\nLorenz Lorenzen was born June 8, 1660, in Schleswig (at that time a duchy ruled by Denmark). His father was a town burgess and loved music, so he saw to it that his son was musically educated. Lorenzen studied at the University of Rostock and in the city of Kiel, where he changed his name to the Latin version, Laurentius Laurenti. In 1684 he became cantor and director of music at the Cathedral Church of Bremen, Germany, and held this position for 38 years until his death on May 29, 1722.\n\nSarah Laurie (Borthwick) Findlater’s translation appeared in Hymns From the Land of Luther, 1854, to which she contributed 53 hymns. Her sister Jane Bothwick (see SDAH 357) contributed the other 69 items. Sarah was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on November 26, 1823. Her father was an insurance executive. A naturally gifted poet, she became the wife of Erick Findlater, pastor of the Free Church of Scotland at Lochearnhead, Perthshire. She died at Torquay, Devonshire, on December 25, 1907. The translations made by these Borthwick sisters are universally considered to be of high quality.\n\nGREENLAND is from the Lausanne Psalter, 1790, and received the name from later use with Heber’s “From Greenland’s Icy Mountains.” The music is thought to be one of the verses from Michael Haydn’s “Services for Country Churches.” On Johann Michael Haydn, see SDAH 83.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

The words are a composite of Bible texts or portions, the theme being the solemn injunction to the church of Philadelphia to endure to the end: “Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown” (Rev. 3:11).\n\nThe tune, unnamed as with many of Belden’s compositions, has simple harmony, but the melody is sufficiently singable to carry the solemn words.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

The metaphors change, however, from a citizen inside a walled town to a traveler on a ship bound for harbor. It will be noted that the language of the last two stanzas uses much of the language of the questions in the first two. The hymn was first printed, words and music, in the 1855 Hymns for Those …, by James White. It has been used only in SDA hymnals since then.\n\nThe tune ZION was composed in 1830 in Washington, Connecticut, by Thomas Hastings (1784-1872; see SDAH 300). It was first set to Thomas Kelly’s hymn “On the Mountain Top Appearing,” which tells of a herald carrying good things to Zion. Hastings also composed tunes for SDAH 300, TOPLADY, and SDAH 527, RETREAT.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "yearWritten": 1853,
    "historicalContext": "The author of this hymn, Uriah Smith, was born on May 2, 1832, in West Wilton, New Hampshire. In his boyhood he followed William Miller’s teachings, but after the disappointment in 1844, when the Lord did not return to earth, he lost interest in religion. However, he was reconverted in 1852 and in the next year joined the staff of the Review and Herald to begin what was to be a period of 50 years of denominational service. He edited the Review for many years; invented a school desk; because his own artificial leg hampered his movement, patented a better artificial leg; was an accomplished writer and a deep student of the Word of God; and was was a pillar of the Seventh-day Adventist church in its developing and expanding years. He was secretary of the General Conference for five different periods totaling 21 years, and treasurer for one year, 1876-1877. He died March 6, 1903, at Battle Creek, Michigan. He is probably best known as the author of the monumental work Thoughts on Daniel and the Revelation. The words of this hymn are a fit epitaph of his own life, which was remarkable for its faithfulness to duty. The poem appeared on the front page of the Review and Herald, September 27, 1853, with instructions to be sung to the tune of the song “Be Kind to the Loved Ones at Home.” As would be expected, the hymn is replete with allusions to the Scriptures.\n\nThe tune suggested by Smith was to a secular song beginning “Be kind to thy father, for when thou wert young.” The song was written in 1847 by Jacob E. Hosmer, and the tune by Isaac Baker Woodbury (1819-1858) of Beverly, Massachusetts. At 13 years of age Woodbury went to Boston to learn music, but learned the trade of blacksmithing. However, music was the dominant factor in his life, and he played, edited, learned, and composed music. He learned the violin and promoted singing in schools and in choirs. At the age of 19 he went for a year’s study of music to London and to Paris. The first of many visits to Europe. He founded a musical association in Vermont and composed many popular secular songs. In 1849 he moved to New York, where he became a music teacher, and edited The Musical Review and The Musical Pioneer. With help from others he compiled the Boston Musical Education Society’s Collection of Church Music in 1842 and The Choral in 1845. Another of his publication was The New Lute of Zion in which he stated his philosophy of music was to worship God in simple song rather than to treat music as a form of art. Woodbury never enjoyed good health; on a trip to seek a cure in the southern United States he died at Columbia, South Carolina, in 1858, at the early age of 39.\n\nThe song “Be Kind to Thy Father” appeared as a gospel song in the American Sunday School Hymn Book, 1860, for it does promote the Christian grace of kindness. The three other stanzas begin “Be kind to thy mother,” “Be kind to thy brother,” “Be kind to thy sister,” respectively.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "In the year 1848 Abraham Lincoln spoke in Congress against war in Mexico, for it appeared to him to be merely an excuse for the slave-holding states of the South to gain more territory and thus extend slavery. James Russell Lowell supported this protest by writing a long poem of 18 stanzas of five lines each, entitled “The Present Crisis.” The poem was reduced to four stanzas of eight lines each by W. Garrett Horder (1841- 1922). Horder was a Congregational minister in England who was specially interested in hymnology and compiled several hymnals. He took Lowell’s poem, which appeared in his Poems of 1849, selected sentences from the poem as he pleased, and produced the present hymn. It was printed in Horder’s Hymns, Supplemental to Existing Collections, 1894. Notice that the word truth occurs in each stanza; the emphasis throughout son standing for truth, even if in a minority.\n\nJames Russell Lowell was born on February 22, 1819, at Cambridge, Massachusetts. He studied at Harvard, graduating in 1838. He took up law 1840; from 1855 to 1871 he was professor of language and literature at from 1857 to 1861, and the North American Review from 1863 to 1872. In Harvard, succeeding the poet Longfellow. He edited the Atlantic Monthly 1877 he was appointed as United States minister to Spain and in 1880 as ambassador to England, serving until 1885. He was poet, essayist, and diplomat; he sided strongly with the abolitionists in the slavery issue, particularly while editor of The Pennsylvania Freeman. He died August 12, 1891, at Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nThe tune TON-Y-BOTEL, also used for “God Has Spoken by His Prophets,” was composed in 1890 by Thomas John Williams (1869-1944; see SDAH 413).\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Harry Emerson Fosdick, one of America’s great preachers, was born University, Union Theological Seminary, and Columbia University, and May 24, 1878, in Buffalo, New York. He studied at Colgate was ordained a Baptist minister in 1903. After pastoring the First Baptist Church. Montclair, New Jersey, and serving for a time as chaplain to American troops in World War I, he became pastor at First Presbyterian Church, New York City, in 1919. But his strong feelings about ecumenism led to his resignation, and John D. Rockefeller, Jr., asked him to pastor the prestigious Park Avenue Baptist Church. He refused because of the requirement of baptism by immersion, but Rockefeller regarded him so highly that he built for him a new church on Riverside Drive. It was to have no baptism requirement but would be open to all people as an ecumenical church.\n\nWhile on vacation at Boothbay Harbor, Maine, Fosdick wrote these words of challenge; they were sung at the opening service in the new church, and later at its dedication February 8, 1931. In one sermon, before the church was finished, Fosdick said, “It could be wicked for us to have that new church-wicked! Whether it is going to be wicked or not depends on what we do with it. We must justify the possession of that magnificent equipment by the service that comes out of it.” This kind of self-analysis might profitably be applied to every church in every kind of “new equipment” situation. Notice Fosdick’s strong feelings in stanza 3: “Shame our wanton, selfish gladness, rich in goods and poor in soul.”\n\nIn addition to teaching theology and homiletics at Union Theological Seminary, Fosdick conducted the National Vespers radio broadcast from 1926 to 1946 and was the author of some 30 inspirational books. He died at Bronxville, New York, October 5, 1969.\n\nHenry Purcell was born in 1659 in Westminster, London. Educated by his father and uncle, he became a chorister in the Chapel Royal. In 1673, at age 14, he was apprenticed to an organ builder, John Hingston, who enjoyed a great reputation as builder of small, or “regal,” organs. In those days, the builder of organs had a greater status than the organ performer. For two years Purcell composed and copied music, and tuned the organ in Westminster Abbey. Then he succeeded Matthew Locke as “composer to the King’s violins.” In 1679, at the young age of 20, he became organist at Westminster Abbey, receiving 10 pounds a year in salary! He was director of music for the coronation of James II in 1685 and again of William and Mary in 1689. He wrote a great volume of music for the church, organ works, theater pieces, solo works, and royal odes. Unfortunately, his creative output was cut short by death, at the early age of 36, on November 21, 1695.\n\nWESTMINSTER ABBEY is named for the great cathedral in London where the composer was organist; later he was buried there with full honors. The tune is from the “Alleluias” in his anthem “O God, Thou Art My God,” which was published by William Boyce in Cathedral Music, 1760. It did not achieve popularity until matched with the text “Blessed City, Heavenly Salem” and sung at the weddings of Princess Margaret in 1960 and Prince Charles in 1981.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

He went into business selling shoes at retail, and later served for 15 years as a department manager for E. L. and G. D. Kenyon, a hardware store. For ten years beginning in 1886, he edited a local newspaper. At age 21 he obtained a license to preach in the Methodist Church, but later switched to the Baptists and served as pastor of the West Bethany Free Will Baptist Church for seven years. A book of his work, Poems and Ballads, was published in 1897. He died September 5, 1900.\n\nYates sent a number of his poems to Ira D. Sankey, who set this one to music, and published it in The Christian Endeavor Hymnbook. It also appeared about that same year, 1891, in Gospel Hymns No. 6.\n\nFor comments on Ira D.

    "historicalContext": "Isaac Watts (1674-1748; see Biographies) published a large number of This sermons between 1721 and 1724, and to many of them he added a special hymn. Sermon number 31, entitled “Holy Fortitude, a Remedy Against Fear,” was based on 1 Corinthians 16:13: “Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.”\n\nThe tune ARLINGTON comes from a melody composed by Thomas Augustine Arne (1710-1778), of London. He was the principal composer of his time, and wrote songs for all the London theaters. He was the composer of the British sea song “Rule, Britannia.” This melody occurs in a minuet in the overture to his opera Artaxerxes, which was produced at the Covent Garden theater in 1762. The melody was arranged as a hymn tune by Ralph Harrison (1748-1810), a Unitarian minister who served at Shrewsbury for two years, 1769-1771, and then in Manchester until his death. He collected several hymn tunes, including some of his own for the use of his Manchester congregation in his compilation Sacred Harmony, 1784. Harrison also taught classics at the Manchester Academy, which he helped found.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "This his hymn by Philip Doddridge (1702-1751; see SDAH 597) was published posthumously, as were most of his hymns, by his friend Job Orton in Hymns Founded on Various Texts in the Holy Scriptures, 1755. It was entitled “Pressing on in the Christian Race” and had five stanzas. The hymn was used for those who had been newly confirmed, although it is applicable to any stage of the Christian’s experience. Scripture allusions are plentiful, as Doddridge used to write a hymn, based on his sermon, to conclude the church service. Doddridge also wrote hymn No. 597, “Ye Servants of the Lord.”\n\nCHESTERFIELD appears in the ninth edition of Carmina Christo (Songs to Christ), 1792, which was a compilation of 139 hymns and tunes by Thomas Haweis. It was unnamed in this publication and set to the hymn by Haweis beginning “O Thou from whom all goodness flows.” Haweis was born at Redruth, Cornwall, on January 1, 1734. He was surgeon, but after practicing this profession for a time he changed course and studied for the ministry. He was ordained an Anglican minister in 1757, but while curate at St. Mary Magdalen, Oxford, he was removed from office because of his sympathy toward the Methodists. After two other appointments he became chaplain to Lady Huntingdon’s Connexion at Bath, and manager of the college that she established in Wales. He published a history of the church, a translation of the New Testament, and a Bible commentary. He was most interested in foreign missions and took part in organizing the London Missionary Society. He retired to Bath, Somerset, where he died on February 11, 1820.\n\nThe name CHESTERFIELD commemorates Lord Chesterfield (1694- 1773), member of Parliament, ambassador at The Hague for two years, statesman, and author, who often visited the Countess of Huntingdon. In the Collection of Psalm-Tunes, 1808, by Samuel Webbe the younger (see SDAH 477), the tune is also named RICHMOND, after Webbe’s friend, Leigh Richmond.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "It is somewhat unusual to find in a hymnbook words written by a famous novelist, to a tune composed by a well-known musician who wrote music for comic opera. Such, however, is the case with this hymn. The words are by Sabine Baring-Gould (1834-1924; see SDAH 52), and the music is by Arthur Seymour Sullivan (1842-1900; see SDAH 169). In 1864 Sabine Baring-Gould was the new curate at Horbury Bridge, a village in West Yorkshire. He was accorded the courtesy of selecting the hymns for the annual Whitmonday procession of Sunday school children from one village to another. On this particular occasion Baring-Gould could find nothing in the way of music that appeared to him to be suitable. So taking one of the hymns with music by Haydn, he sat up far into the night and that he wrote the words in 1865, they nevertheless appear in the Church Wrote these stirring martial words. In spite of Baring-Gould’s statement Times of October 15, 1864, page 331, under the general heading “Mission Hymns, VII. Hymn for Procession With Cross and Banners.” It carries the initials “S. B. G.” Baring-Gould also wrote SDAH 52, “Now the Day Is Over.”\n\nThe hymn was made extremely popular by the marching tune composed in 1871 specially for these words. It appeared in the Musical Times of December of that year, by Arthur Seymour Sullivan. At the time, he was a guest in the home of Gertrude Clay-Ker-Seymer in Hanford, Dorset. Sullivan commemorated her name by making her a “saint” and affixing this title to his tune. He also composed SDAH 169, ST. KEVIN; 582, ST. EDMUND; and arranged 568, LEOMINSTER.\n\nThis stirring hymn has been sung on more than one great occasion. On August 10, 1941, Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill met on the deck of the British battleship Prince of Wales for the signing of the historic Atlantic a document that would combine the efforts of the two countries in the fight against Hitler in World War II. The two leaders had chosen the hymns to be sung for the Sunday morning church service. Churchill chose “O God, Our Help in Ages Past” and “Onward, Christian Soldiers,” and Roosevelt wanted “Eternal Father, Strong to Save,” so all three of these favorites were sung by the sailors aboard ship. Later, Churchill said in a broadcast to his people: “We sang ‘Onward, Christian Soldiers,’ and indeed, I felt that this was no vain presumption but that we had the right to feel that we were serving a cause for the sake of which a trumpet has sounded from on high.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "This hymn was in Monsell’s Hymns of Love and Praise for the Church’s Year 1863, a collection that he dedicated to two of his children. Altogether he wrote some 300 hymns, which were published in 11 volumes.\n\nJohn Samuel Bewley Monsell (1811-1875; see SDAH 6) was an Irish-born minister of the Anglican Church. He also wrote SDAH 6, “O Worship the Lord,” and SDAH 68, “On Our Way Rejoicing.”\n\nWilliam Boyd was born at Montego Bay, Jamaica, and received his early training in England from Sabine Baring-Gould. After attendance at St. Edmund Hall, Oxford, and experience as a choral scholar at Worcester College, he became a priest in the Church of England and served as rector in Sussex and vicar of All Saints, Norfolk Square, London. He stayed at the latter from 1893 until his retirement in 1918. His final years were spent in blindness, and he died February 16, 1928.\n\nThe tune PENTECOST was written at the request of Sabine Baring- Gould to go with the text “Come, Holy Ghost, Our Souls Inspire,” and was first published in Thirty-two Hymn Tunes Composed by Members of the University of Oxford, 1868. Boyd himself tells the story of the tune in the Musical Times, XLIX, 1908: “One day, as I was walking along Regent Street, I felt a slap on my back, and turning round I saw my dear old friend Arthur Sullivan [see SDAH 169].  ‘My dear Billy,’ he said, ‘I’ve seen a tune of yours which I must have.’ (He was then editing Church Hymns.) ‘All right,’ I said. ‘Send me a [check] and I agree. No copy of the book, much less a proof, was sent to me, and when I saw the tune I was horrified to find that Sullivan had assigned it to Fight the Good Fight.’ We had a regular fisticuffs about it, but judging from the favor with which the tune has been received, I feel that Sullivan was right in so mating words and music.\n\n“The tune was printed in the 1875 edition of Hymns Ancient and Modern without my permission. In their last edition they turned me out, also without my permission. Still, they had to come back, I rejoice to say, for people said, the old was better.’ Since then it has found its way into most collections, Church of England and Nonconformist, and has gone all over the English- speaking world.  To give you an instance of its far-reaching sweep, let me mention a reminiscence. On landing at Jamaica in January, 1902, I was approaching the great church at Kingston-now a desolation since the earthquake-when a quarter of a mile off, I heard my tune being heartily sung-bellowed, I had almost said-by a congregation of 2,000, mostly Black people. The effect was deafening.”\n\nWhen the Musical Times asked for a copy of the tune to reproduce with his article, Boyd replied: “With pleasure. It is only four notes! [Actually it has five.] And I will write the heading ‘Pentecost,’ because ‘Pen’ is the first syllable of my wife’s name, and she is very fond of the tune.” (He named it PENTECOST because it was originally written for a text about the Holy Spirit, as noted above.)\n\nThe tune does seem more suited to a prayer for the Holy Spirit than to this one of Christian warfare. But there is no accounting for the will of the people in such matters.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "authorBirthDeath": "",
    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": 1911,
    "historicalContext": "The author of the original of this poem, William P. Merrill, gives this account of how it was written: “Nolan R. Best, then editor of The Continent [Presbyterian magazine], happened to say to me that there was urgent need of a brotherhood hymn …. The suggestion lingered in my mind, and just about that time [1911] I came upon an article by Gerald Stanley Lee, entitled ‘The Church of the Strong Men.’ I was on one of the Lake Michigan steamers going back to Chicago for a Sunday at my own church, when suddenly this hymn came up, almost without conscious thought or effort.” “To the Brotherhood,” It was published in the above magazine, and the same year appeared as a hymn in Shephard’s Hymns of the Centuries with FESTAL SONG.\n\nAt a time when the brotherhood movement was strong in the Presbyterian Church, this hymn was a trumpet call to men to stand up and be counted for God:\n\nRise up, O men of God! Have done with lesser things; Give heart and soul and mind and strength. To serve the King of kings.\n\nIn the early work of the SDAH Committee for this book, Merrill’s hymn was voted as is a hymn of challenge to men. But in later meetings as the committee members became more conscious of the exclusive language of many hymns, they questioned the wisdom of including it in its familiar form and voted it down because of the several exclusively male-oriented phrases.\n\nOttilie Stafford, (1921-; see SDAH 398), a member of the committee, tells how her adaptation came about: “The rousing quality of both words and music was attractive, and everyone regretted losing the hymn. One day, after we had argued about it once more, during a break in the meetings I sat down to see if the words could be changed to include women. I discovered that by rearranging the order of the stanzas and by doing some rewriting they could be changed. Then Ron Graybill [another committee member] suggested that we include a stanza for young people. That way the entire church could be included. That was an exciting idea! By the time the day’s meetings had come to an end, we had copies of the new words for the hymn, and the committee sang them. The unanimous vote of the committee to include it showed that we were all happy that the problem was resolved, and we now had the hymn we all wanted but had become resigned to losing.”\n\nWilliam Pierson Merrill was born January 10, 1867, at Orange, New Jersey. He was educated at Rutgers College and Union Theological Semi- nary, New York, and began his pastoral work in 1890 in Philadelphia. After 16 years in Chicago he went to the famous Brick Presbyterian Church in New York City, where for 27 years he developed a reputation as a great preacher, dedicated leader, and writer of inspirational books. From 1915 he was president of the Church Peace Union. He received degrees from Rutgers College and New York University, and Columbia University honored him with a doctoral degree in 1927. He retired in 1938 and died on June 19, 1954, in New York City.\n\nFor FESTAL SONG and William Henry Walter (1825-1893), see SDAH 117.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "This rousing battle cry is a very small selection from a hymn written in 1749 by Charles Wesley (1707-1788; see Biographies) and appeared in his Hymns and Sacred Poems of that year. Its title was “The Whole Armor of God,” and it consisted of 16 stanzas, of which we have Nos. 1, 2, and 16. Later his brother John divided it into three separate hymns, beginning respectively with stanzas 1, 7, and 13. Note the transliterated Greek work panoply in stanza 2, line 4, which means “all the arms, or armor,” taken from the original in Ephesians 6:13. In fact the hymn is an extended paraphrase of Paul’s vivid description of the Christian warfare and the necessary weapons. Reference is also made to Romans 8:37: “In all these things we are more than conquerors.”\n\nThe tune DIADEMATA (crowns) was composed especially for the hymn “Crown Him With Many Crowns,” by Sir George Job Elvey (1816-1893; see SDAH 223). Note that the melody of line 6 is exactly the same as in line 5, but one note higher. Elvey also composed SDAH 557, ST. GEORGE’S WINDSOR. The arrangement is by Melvin West (1930-; see Biographies).\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "yearWritten": 1840,
    "historicalContext": "Arthur Cleveland Coxe, in his Athanasion and Miscellaneous Poems, edition of 1842, included a 10-stanza poem of four lines each, entitled “Watchwords.” It was written in 1840, at a time when the slavery question was very much to the fore and when the war with Mexico was the following three are by another author. It was first published a Impending. The first two stanzas make up the first stanza in SDAH, but in the Millerite Adventist book Millennial Musings, “a choice collection of hymns designed for the use of Second Advent meetings,” by Joshua V. Himes and Josiah Litch, Boston, 1841.\n\nCoxe was born on May 10, 1818, at Mendham, New Jersey, the son of a prominent Presbyterian minister. He followed his father’s calling and trained for the ministry, but was an ordained Protestant Episcopal. He then added an e to his name, becoming Coxe instead of Cox. He was rector of bishop of Western New York. He had written poetry, but when he was a churches in Connecticut, Maryland, and New York City, and in 1865 became member of the hymnal commission of his own church, he refused to permit any of his poems to be used in the Episcopal Hymnal, 1871. Coxe died July 20, 1896, at Clifton Springs, New York.\n\nThe tune, appropriately called THE ALARM, is by an unknown composer, but when played in quick march time, it fits the urgency of the words. The succession of repeated notes in the melody in lines 5 and 6 offers a good contrast to the descending and ascending scale passages in the last two lines.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "yearWritten": 1858,
    "historicalContext": "The Reverend Dudley Atkins Tyng was an ardent opponent of slavery, but the majority of his congregation in the Epiphany Episcopal Church in Philadelphia were slaveowners, and they forced his resignation. However, he was induced to continue his revivalist preaching in Jayne’s Hall, and had great success. One Sunday in 1858 he preached to an audience of 5,000 people; more than 1,000 of them signed a pledge indicating their conversion. The following Wednesday, Tyng was in the country looking at a piece of farm machinery when his sleeve was accidently caught in the cogs. His arm was dragged into the machine and torn off, the serious injuries proving fatal. Knowing his end was near, sent a last message to the Young Men’s Christian Association in Philadelphia, “Tell them to stand up for Jesus,” possibly thinking of Psalm 94:16, “Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?” His friend George Duffield, a Presbyterian minister, was inspired by Tyng’s dying words, and wrote this hymn as an exhortation, using it in the funeral sermon preached the following Sunday, April 25.\n\nDuffield was born on September 12, 1818, at Carlisle, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Yale with a B.A. in 1837, and from the Union Theological Seminary in New York in 1840. He entered the Presbyterian ministry and between 1840 and 1884 served in churches in New York City, New Jersey, Philadelphia, Michigan, and Illinois. For some years he edited the Presby- terian Christian Observer; Knox College granted him an honorary D.D. degree in 1871. He retired in 1884 to Bloomfield, New Jersey, where he had been a minister from 1847 to 1852, and died there on July 6, 1888.\n\nThe tune WEBB commemorates George James Webb, who composed it in 1837 while on a voyage from England to America, as a setting for a secular song beginning, “”Tis dawn, the lark is singing.” It was printed in Mason and Webb’s Cantica Laudis, 1850, and named GOODWIN there, although it appeared earlier in 1837 in a Boston collection, The Odeon, to the above. It was set to a hymn text “The Morning Light Is Breaking” in 1842 in The Wesleyan Psalmist; the tune carries the name MORNING LIGHT in some hymnals. The hymn as it now stands first appeared in a hymnal in the Church Psalmist, 1859.\n\nWebb was born on June 24, 1803, at Rushmore House, near Salisbury, the son of a farmer. He studied music and was organist at Falmouth in Cornwall, but in 1830 emigrated to the United States and became an organist in Boston. Here he associated with Lowell Mason (see Biographies) in the founding of the Boston Academy of Music, and he was professor of secular music there. He became a Swedenborgian in 1835. From 1840 to 1843 he was president of the Boston Handel and Haydn Society. He moved to Orange 1870, then in 1876 to New York City, where he taught singing. He was noted as a choral conductor and an orchestral teacher; he composed several anthems and hymn tunes. He retired to Orange, New Jersey, in 1885 and died there on October 7, 1887.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

They already knew the tune LANCASHIRE, so Shurtleff wrote these three stanzas in that meter. While the words breathe a martial spirit, which is enhanced by the music, there is nevertheless a recognition that “the kingdom of God cometh not with observation. For, behold, the kingdom of God is within you” (Luke 17: 20, 21).\n\nShurtleff was born on April 4, 1862, in Boston, Massachusetts. He studied at Harvard and trained for the ministry, graduating from the Andover Theological Seminary in 1887. He was ordained to the Congrega- tional ministry in 1889 and occupied pastorates in California, Massachusetts, and Minnesota. In 1905 he went to Frankfurt, Germany, and while there Paris and did relief work during World War I until his death in Paris, organized the American Church. He worked among the American students in August 24, 1917. He was the author of several books.\n\nLANCASHIRE was composed in 1835 by Henry Smart (1813-1879; see SDAH 119) for the 300th anniversary of the Reformation in England. It sung to the words “From Greenland’s Icy Mountains” at the music festival at Blackburn in Lancashire (hence the name) on October 4, 1835. Smart also Composed SDAH 119, REGENT SQUARE. LANCASHIRE first appeared in Psalms and Hymns for Divine Worship, 1867.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": 1787,
    "historicalContext": "The first printing of this hymn was in John Rippon’s Selection of Hymns, London, 1787, under the heading “Heaven Anticipated.” The original had eight four-line stanzas. The refrain was added much later.\n\nThis figure of crossing the swelling, stormy river of Jordan before death and entering the heavenly Canaan to enjoy eternal life is not strictly biblical. It is a parallel to the time when the Israelites in Joshua’s time came to cross the Jordan River and found the banks flooded (see Joshua 3). The Lord caused the waters to cease so that the Israelites could pass over into Canaan’s land. Another incident associated with the Jordan and with death and eternal life concerns the translation of the prophet Elijah. He was crossing in the other direction, from Jericho eastward. Again a miracle was performed, for Elijah smote the waters with his mantle and he and Elisha went over on dry ground (2 Kings 2:8). In neither case was there a struggle against Jordan’s waves; we owe this figure to John Bunyan’s usage in Pilgrim’s Progress, when all the trumpets sounded for Christian from the other side as he made a triumphal crossing of the watery barrier between him and the Delectable Country.\n\nJohn Rippon (1751-1836) was born at Tiverton, Devon, England, and prepared for the ministry at Baptist College, Bristol. He was the pastor of Carter Lane Baptist Church in London for 63 years! His most significant contribution to hymnody was a collection of hymns he put together in 1787, A Selection of Hymns From the Best Authors, Intended as an Appendix to Dr. Watts’s Psalms and Hymns. Several editions of this work were published until it eventually contained some 1,170 hymns in 100 different meters.\n\nSamuel Stennett, born at Exeter, England, in 1727, was also a Baptist minister. He succeeded his father as pastor of the Seventh Day Baptist Church in Little Wild Street, London, in 1758, and served there until his death. Holding a prominent position among the “dissenting” ministers of London, he was respected by the statesmen of his time for his stand on religious liberty, a tenet strongly held by Baptists, who were considered heretics by the established Church of England. He was a personal friend of King George III, and not only preached regularly on seventh-day Sabbaths, but also for the other Baptists on Sundays. His published works include sermons, pamphlets, and 38 hymns in Rippon’s book. In 1763 he was granted an honorary D.D. degree by the University of Aberdeen, Scotland. He died in London August 25, 1795.\n\nIt is undoubtedly the delightful music of PROMISED LAND that has made this hymn so popular since it first appeared in William Walker’s Southern Harmony, 1835, where credit is given to Miss M. Durham. Nothing about her is known. William “Singing Billy” Walker (1809-1875) was a Baptist layman and singing-school teacher of South Carolina, who wrote some 25 tunes for his successful book, of which 600,000 copies were sold in 30 years. An all-day “sing” that started in 1884, using this book, is still carried on in Benton, Kentucky, every fourth Sunday in May.\n\nOriginally PROMISED LAND was in F sharp minor. Rigdon M. McIntosh, onetime head of the Music Department of Vanderbilt University and music editor of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, publishing house, changed it to F major. The SDAH arrangement is by Melvin West (1930-; see Biographies).\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

It has been brought forward into successive hymnals of the Seventh-day Adventist Church seven times, including this one. A look at the text will show that it was certainly written by an Adventist, probably one of the Millerites. (There were as yet no Seventh-day Adventists.) The Dictionary of American Hymnology first-line index reveals that this hymn of expectation of the second coming of the Lord has been used only in SDA hymnals.\n\nThe tune ELLESDIE, also used for SDAH 325, was arranged in 1873 by Hubert P. Main (1839-1926; see SDAH 36) from an original tune that also composed SDAH 36, BELOVED, and SDAH 456, sometimes called came from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (see SDAH 325).

    "yearWritten": 1846,
    "historicalContext": "This stirring hymn made famous by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, was written while Clayton was accompanying Brigham Young on a journey from the Mormon base at Nauvoo, Illinois, to winter quarters. An entry in his journal, dated April 15, 1846, gives the only reference to the writing of this hymn: “This morning I composed a new song-‘All Is Well.’ The following story is from the Mormon Relief Society Magazine. 1921: “President Young, feeling great anxiety because there were murmurings in the camp of Israel, called Elder William Clayton ” aside and said, ‘Brother Clayton, I want you to write a hymn that the people can sing at their campfires in the evening; something that will give them succor and support, and help them to fight the many troubles and trials of the journey.’ Elder Clayton withdrew from the camp and in two hours returned with the hymn. His personal testimony is to the effect that ‘it was written under the favor and inspiration of the Lord.'”\n\nAnother story relates how Clayton received a letter from his wife, Diantha, who was pregnant and remained at home. She gave him the good news that they now had a son, and closed with “All is well.”\n\nThese were also the closing words of a song in The Sacred Harp, 1844, that was familiar at that time:\n\nWhat’s this that steals, that steals upon my frame! Is it death? is it death?\n\nThat soon will quench, will quench this mortal flame. Is it death? is it death?\n\nIf this be death, I soon shall be. From every pain and sorrow free,\n\nI shall the King of glory see. All is well! All is well!\n\nSo his new hymn was composed to fit this meter, retaining that closing reassuring line for each stanza.\n\nHis original had four stanzas, the third of which started out:\n\nWe’ll find a place which God for us prepared, Far away in the west,\n\nWhere none shall come to hurt or make afraid; There the saints will be blessed.\n\nThis, of course, refers to the movement westward by the Mormons to Utah in 1846. The SDAH version consists of two stanzas of the three in the Baptist Hymnal, 1975, which is an adaptation of Clayton’s poem made by “We’ll make the air with music ring,” is Clayton’s original.\n\nWilliam Clayton was born July 17, 1814, in Penwortham, England. At age 23 he became an ardent convert to Mormonism. He closed his private business, was ordained and set apart as a missionary, and was successful in raising up a “branch” of 240 members in Manchester before he came to in America in 1840. His ability was soon recognized; moving to the Nauvoo, Illinois, headquarters of the group, he became secretary to the prophet, Joseph Smith; recorder of the Nauvoo Temple; and treasurer of the city. After the prophet was killed, Clayton was one of the original pioneers who made the difficult journey to the West to find a new home. There he held various offices with distinction and skill. He had played in the Nauvoo Brass Band, and in Salt Lake City he played second violin in the Theater Orchestra. Another of his hymns, “When First the Glorious Light of Truth,” is very precious to the Mormon people. He died December 4, 1879.\n\nJoseph Franklin Green, born June 6, 1924, in Waco, Texas, the son of a Baptist minister, was educated at Texas Wesleyan College (B.S.), Baylor University (M.A.), and Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary (Th. D.). After three years in the Army (1943-1946), he was ordained a Baptist minister and served pastorates in Texas and Colorado before taking up editorial work at Broadman Press. He has written several books and hymn and anthem texts.\n\nThe probable first appearance of the tune ALL IS WELL was in Revival Melodies, Boston, 1842, where it is credited to “C. Dingley.” In 1844, Baptist singing-school teacher B. F. White made some revisions and included it in his Sacred Harp (see comments at SDAH 363) with the text about death mentioned above. A version of the tune with “There is a land, a better land than this” is found in the Seventh-day Adventist Hymns and Tunes, 1886. (See reproductions of both on pages 572 and 573.)\n\nSince there are some measures with three beats in this basically 4/4 tune, the committee elected to omit the time signature, letting the quarter note have its integrity throughout.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "As with most of the other Negro spirituals, it is not possible to ascertain where and when this one was first sung. In his book Negro Slave Songs in the United States, 1953, Miles Mark Fisher tells us that this “Jacob’s ladder” theme was heard in the spirituals as early as 1825. Based on the dream of Jacob as recorded in Genesis 28:10-17, it has the one-idea repetition that was so characteristic of the camp meeting songs of the early 1800s. The final line of each stanza is an echo of 2 Timothy 2:3: “A good soldier of Jesus Christ.”\n\nIn the 1860s, while the slaves of Cherokee County, Alabama were singing, “I am climbing up Jacob’s ladder; Don’t you grieve after me,” there came from Durham, North Carolina, another concept, “Climb up Jacob’s ladder, higher and higher, ‘Way in the kingdom.”\n\nEllen White, in her book The Desire of Ages, makes this application of the imagery: “Christ is the ladder that Jacob saw, the base resting on the earth, and the topmost round reaching to the gate of heaven, to the very threshold of glory. If that ladder had failed by a single step of reaching the earth, we should have been lost. But Christ reaches us where we are. He took our nature and overcame, that we through taking His nature might overcome. Made ‘in the likeness of sinful flesh’ (Rom. 8:3), He lived a sinless life. Now by His divinity He lays hold upon the throne of heaven, while by His humanity He reaches us. He bids us by faith in Him attain to the glory of the character of God. Therefore are we to be perfect, even as our ‘Father which is in heaven is perfect'” (pp. 311, 312).\n\nWhere the congregation is able, it might be appropriate to sing the first three stanzas a cappella in four-part, improvised harmony, starting in the key of B and progressing upward one-half step with each stanza. Then on the last stanza, all could sing the melody in unison, while the accompaniment plays the harmonization by Melvin West (1930-; see Biographies).\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Not all carols are about the birth of Christ. This happy sounding one is a delightful way to sing about and tell again the story of Genesis 28:10-12: “And Jacob… went toward Haran…. And he … tarried there all night… and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows…  And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.” At first thought, climbing a ladder round by round seems like working one’s way to heaven. But the refrain beautifully brings us back each time to the truth that the ladder is righteousness by faith in Jesus Christ, who has “raised up a ladder of mercy for me.” Children of all ages will enjoy singing this. It is probably of eighteenth-century English origin. The Oxford Book of Carols makes this comment: “This is apparently a carol to which new words were fitted under the influence of the Methodist revival.”\n\nGerald Hocken Knight was born July 27, 1908, at Wyngarvey, near St. Austell, Cornwall, England. He was educated at Truro Cathedral School, Peterhouse, Cambridge (where he was choral scholar); College of St. Nicholas, Chislehurst; and the Royal College of Music, and received the B.A., M.A., and B.Mus. degrees. His distinguished career includes positions as organist at Truro Cathedral, Peterhouse, in Cambridge; organist and choirmaster at St. Augustine’s, Queensgate; and the same position at the great Canterbury Cathedral from 1937 to 1952. During World War II he served as an airman and education officer in the Royal Air Force. He was associate director of the Royal School of Church Music from 1947 to 1952, and became director in that final year. In addition to composing and arranging much church music, he wrote the music for two of Dorothy L. Sayers’ musical plays, performed at Canterbury Cathedral. When Hymns Ancient and Modern was revised in 1950, he was one of the musical editors. He died in 1979.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "Joseph, a native of Sicily, was born about the year A.D. 800. He was captured by pirates and became a slave in Crete. He was later set free and became a monk in Constantinople, where he wrote such a large number of hymns that he became known to posterity as Joseph the Hymnographer. From one of his canons, written about A.D. 840, on the saints Chrysanthus and Daria, John Mason Neale (1818-1866; see Biographies) gained the inspiration to write this hymn, which cannot be identified with any words in the original Greek canon. Joseph died about the year 1883 in the monastery where he had spent much of his life. John M. Neale’s very free translation, or it may be an original hymn, contained eight stanzas and appeared in his Hymns of the Eastern Church, 1862.\n\nThe tune VULPIUS, not to be confused with GELOBT SEI GOTT (SDAH 173), which carries the name VULPIUS in other hymnals, is an arrangement from Melchior Vulpius, a German composer who contributed many fine melodies to the Lutheran Church. He was born about 1560 in Wasungen, about 85 miles northeast of Frankfurt on Main, now in East Germany. In 1602 he was appointed cantor at Weimar and remained in that position until his death in August 1615. Prior to this appointment he had been a teacher and cantor in Schleusingen, and then cantor at Zittau. He published Gesangbuch (Hymnbook) in 1609, Cantiones Sacrae (Sacred Songs) in 1602, and Kirchengesänge und geistliche Lieder Dr. Luther’s (Church Hymns and Spiritual Songs of Dr. Luther) in 1604. He composed a St. Matthew Passion, 1612-1614. Vulpius also composed the tune for SDAH 173, GELOBT SEI GOTT.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Robert Seagrave wrote this hymn in 1742 for his own congregation whom he address every Sunday evening in the Lorimers, Hall in London. This was the headquarters of the guild of lorimers, makers of spurs for riders and leather straps and bits for horses. He had left the Anglican Church the previous year, dissatisfied with the lackadaisical attitude of the clergy generally and their lack of response to the reforming zeal of Wesley and Whitefield. He published the hymn in his Hymns for Christian Worship, 1742, and entitled it “The Pilgrim’s Song.” The words give some idea of the troubles experienced by the new Methodists and raise their thoughts from earth to heaven.\n\nSeagrave was born on November 22, 1693, in the small village of Twyford, nine miles from Leicester, England. He graduated from Cambridge University in 1714, was ordained to the Anglican ministry, and joined John Wesley and George Whitefield in their revival campaign to preach the gospel to the masses. He wrote numerous letters and pamphlets between 1731 and 1746 in an endeavor to stir the clergy. Ultimately he joined Whitefield, became his intimate friend, and often preached in his tabernacle. He died in London in the year 1750.\n\nThe tune AMSTERDAM is one of six tunes adapted by John Wesley from J. A. Freylinghausen’s Geistreiches Gesangbuch (Spiritual Hymnbook), 1704, and published in his Collection of Tunes as They Are Sung in the Foundery, 1742. It has been attributed to James Nares (1715-1783) who was an organist at York Minster and later at the Chapel Royal, Windsor, and a trainer of boys’ choirs. He was christened at Stanwell, Middlesex, on April 19, 1715, and died at Westminster, also in Middlesex, on February 10, 1783. He received the D.Mus. from the University of Cambridge in 1756, and published treatises on singing and on playing the organ and the harpsichord. It will be noticed that the form is AABA, scores 1, 2, and 4 being almost identical.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "Orian Wren (1936-; see Biographies) wrote this while visiting in Bohio, July 14, 1983. In March, 1984 the SDAH Committee wrote to him at his home in Oxford, England, telling him that six hymn texts of his had been voted up to that date. He was invited to submit any new and unpublished hymn texts he had recently written and would like to have considered for inclusion. He responded most graciously with a sheaf of manuscripts, among them this one with the heading “The Sure Foundation-a Salute to the American Evangelical Tradition.” The first two stanzas are in the second person, talking about Christ as the answer to the “aching,” “loveless, unfulfilling” dark times in our lives. The third stanza is a direct invitation to accept Christ as the “open door to life and peace.” Scripture allusions are: “My peace give unto you: not as the world giveth” (John 14:27) and “I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone he, a sure foundation” (Isa. 28:16).\n\nHymns and Tunes, an official book of 1,413 items, was published by the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists in 1886. Serving on the committee were George I. Butler, Uriah Smith (see SDAH 602), J. H. Waggoner, A. R. Henry, and Edwin Barnes (see SDAH 6). F. E. Belden (see Biographies) and Barnes were the musical editors. From the preface, this paragraph explains the section Miscellaneous-Old Melodies: “A special effort has been made to gather up and preserve some old melodies which were favorites in the great Advent movement of 1840-1844, but which have for some reason fallen into disuse. The older members of the household of faith, at least, will be pleased to meet with these again, in this book.”\n\nEMERALD GATES is one of those “old melodies” from Hymns and Tunes, appearing there with the text “Burst ye emerald gates.” No composer is given, only the word arranged.\n\nGeorge Pullen Jackson, in his book, White Spirituals in the Southern Uplands, says he found this tune in the 1820 Supplement to the Kentucky Harmony. The compiler, Ananias Davisson, there claims 11 of the tunes as his own, including EMERALD GATES. Regarding Davisson’s life, a William Blake wrote an article in the magazine Musical Million, 1884: “He was born February 2 1780… I am almost certain it was along the borderline of Maryland and Virginia. He was author of Kentucky Harmony, a book characteristic of that period, abounding in minor tunes. The Wartmanns of Harrisonburg were his publishers. He spent the evening of his life on his farm at Weyer’s Cave, about 14 miles from Dayton [Virginia], and died. aged 76 years. He was a ruling elder in the Presbyterian Church and a man of unaffected piety.” The early part of his life was well occupied with the teaching of singing schools, composing, and publishing music.\n\nBrian Wren suggested the early American tune DROOPING SOULS for his text, but the committee chose EMERALD GATES as being a bit more singable.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

But his dearest loves were the great outdoors, horses, and music. After winning an amateur singing contest, he disregarded his father’s caution, “Never leave the state of Texas!” bought a jalopy with the $100 prize money, and started out on what was to become a successful career in radio, recording, and films. At age 18, in 1926, he persuaded the Victor Talking Machine Company (later RCA) to record some of his cowboy songs. Going to Hollywood, he wrote songs, appeared in concert, and acted in western films. In 1949, as a result of the Billy Graham Crusade in Los Angeles, he accepted Christ and was one of the first to write “pop” sacred songs. His Cowboy Church of the Air radio program was a great success for more than 20 years.\n\nIn 1952 Hamblen’s deep religious convictions brought pressure on his social consciousness and led him to run for president of the United States on the Prohibition ticket. In 1972 he received the Academy of Country & Western Music’s Pioneer Award. Others of His best-known songs are “This Ole House” and “Open Up Your Heart (and Let the Sunshine In).”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

Wilson, district superintendent of the Methodist Philadelphia Conference and later pastor of the Wharton Memorial Methodist Church. She was a gifted musician, and regularly gave of her talents at the Ocean Grove, New Jersey, summer camp meeting, where she met and collaborated with Eliza Hewitt on this song.

She was beloved by the congregations of the churches served. Her musical ability was a great contribution to the work of the local church, together with her ability in dramatic art.”\n\nHer original music was in the key of C and had a repetition of both of the “when we all” phrases in the refrain.

    "historicalContext": "Albert F. Bayly (1901-1984; see Biographies), an English Congregational pastor for nearly 40 years, was considered the dean of a new wave of British hymn writers of our time. This hymn was written for a Christmas fair at Eccleston Congregational Church, St. Helens, Lancashire, where he was pastor from 1956 to 1962. It was first published in his second book of hymns, Again I Say Rejoice, 1967. Slight alterations replace the “Thee” and “Thou” with “You” and “Your.”\n\nThis is but one of several fine stewardship hymns in SDAH. A study of the text reveals how appropriate it could be as a prayer before the offering is taken, either read by the leader, or sung by the choir or congregation. The second stanza reminds us that true stewardship is more than just giving money. It involves also the giving of minds, hands, voices, eyes, hearts-yes, all of our powers to fulfill God’s purpose for our lives. And the closing stanza is a doxology, giving thanks to each member of the Trinity and offering grateful hearts. The hymn catches the spirit of King David after he had collected material for the Temple; he prayed: “I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things” (1 Chron. 29:17).\n\nFor notes on MORESTEAD and Sydney Watson (1903- ), see SDAH 31, “Tell Out My Soul.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Robert Lansing Edwards was born August 5, 1915, at Auburn, New an M.A. from Harvard. After five years of army service as a captain in intelligence in World War II, he went to Union Theological Seminary, New York. Ordained in 1949, he was minister of the Litchfield, Connecticut, First Congregational Church, Hartford. He has been active in work for prisoners and for the blind. In 1968 he served as a the United Church of Christ to the World Council of Churches in Uppsala, Sweden. He has written three hymns and a book of Advent verse. Here are his own words concerning the writing of this hymn: “God, Whose Giving Knows No Ending’ was written in the White Mountains of New Hampshire while we were summering at our cottage in the tiny town of Randolph in 1961. At that time the Hymn Society of America, of which my father was then president, was sponsoring a competition for stewardship hymns. In our family we were in the habit of listening to hymns on records from time to time during those days of leisure. One of them was set to the tune of HYFRYDOL [see SDAH 167, 204], a tune unknown to hymn text to that music me until that time. In some way, the idea of writing gradually slipped into my mind, and in about a month I had my hymn.”\n\nSo, here we have a case where the melodic architecture and accents of a strong tune inspired the writing of a strong text. Notice that, in addition to HYFRYDOL, it goes well with NETTLETON, SDAH 334 (“Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing”).\n\nEdwards’ text was first published by the Hymn Society of America in Ten New Stewardship Hymns, 1961. It was included in The Mennonite Hymnal, 1969 (with HYFRYDOL); Hymns for the Family of God, 1976 (with NETTLETON); and the Lutheran Book of Worship, 1978 (with RUSTINGTON).\n\nThe tune name RUSTINGTON comes from a town in Sussex, England, where Charles H. H. Parry (1848-1918; see SDAH 20) lived for several years. It was first used in The Westminster Abbey Hymn-Book, 1897.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "Somerset Thomas Corry Lowry was born in Dublin, Ireland, on March 21, 1855, educated at Cambridge University, and ordained in the church of England in 1879. Serving a number of churches in England, he was at North Holmwood, near Dorking in Surrey, in 1893 when he wrote this thought-provoking stewardship hymn. It was printed in the Christian Social Union Hymn Book, 1895. Lowry authored several inspirational books, including Hymns and Spiritual Songs, 1910. He died at Torquay, Devonshire,on January 29, 1932.\n\nRalph Vaughan Williams (see Biographies) gets the credit for bringing this Dutch folk song into use as a hymn tune. He got it from Julius Röntgen’s Old Dutch Peasant Songs and Country Dances Transcribed for the Piano, London, 1912, and set it to “See the Conqueror Mounts in Triumph,” by Christopher Wordsworth in the English Hymnal, 1906. He used Röntgen’s harmonization, which SDAH changed only slightly, making the note values quarters and eighths instead of halves and quarters. The tune had been published in Amsterdam earlier (about 1710) in a book of some 1,000 melodies without accompaniment.\n\nJulius Röntgen (1855-1932) was a distinguished Dutch pianist, composer, conductor, teacher, and editor who knew personally Franz Liszt, Brahms, and Edvard Grieg. He was born on May 9, 1855, in Leipzig, Germany, and died in his fatherland at Utrecht on September 13, 1932.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "This hymn comes to us from Hymns of the Saints, the hymnal of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (RLDS), with headquarters in Independence, Missouri. The author writes concerning the hymn: “During the summer of 1965, I was serving staff of the church youth music camp being held at Graceland College. The first day of camp I experienced an allergic reaction in which my whole body was covered with hives, and I felt too ill to leave my room participate in the activities of the day. I became despondent and wondered why the Lord allowed this to happen when I felt my services were needed in the camp. My thoughts then turned to the many who have permanent disabilities and cannot serve the Lord in conventional ways, and how many of them still found acceptable ways to serve Him in their infirmities. Surely I could do no less. Immediately a feeling of gratefulness for my many blessings overshadowed the negative thoughts, and I realized the great privilege it is to be able to serve the Lord under any condition. I felt the urge to record these thoughts in poetic form and was truly blessed as the words flowed easily. It has been a great joy for me to find that these words seem to express the feelings of many others who sing them. During the time of that despondency, the Lord chose me to be an instrument in His hands.”\n\nRaymond (Ray) L. Gunn was born September 11, 1925, in Fort Madison, Iowa. After graduation from high school there, he served in the U.S. Seabees during World War II. After the war he studied at Graceland College, Lamoni, Iowa, and then at Drake University, where he received a master’s degree in music education. He did further graduate study in music and English at Omaha University and the University of Missouri. After teaching high school bands for 13 years in Iowa, he moved to Independence, Missouri, where he is teaching in the Kansas City, Missouri, public schools. He has done pastoral and youth camp work, and was an elder in the RLDS Church for many years. He now attends the Blue Ridge RLDS Church in Independence, where he is an elder, plays the organ, directs the handbell choir, plans the services, and formerly directed the vocal choir.\n\nST. COLUMBA was set to two different texts in the Irish Church Hymnal, 1874, where it carried the heading “Hymn of the Ancient Irish Church.” Charles V. Stanford (see SDAH 32) printed it in his Complete Collection of Irish Music as Noted by George Petrie, 1902, where the caption was “Irish hymn sung on the dedication of a chapel-County of London- derry.” (Erik Routley says that the delightful triplet in the second line was not a part of the original tune, but was the invention of Stanford.) The tempo needs to be slow enough so that these triplet notes have a dignity and grace. Ralph Vaughan Williams (see Biographies) can be credited for matching this tune with “The King of Love My Shepherd Is” in the English Hymnal, 1906, a combination that is found in many hymnbooks today. The tune is named after the celebrated Celtic saint (A.D. 521-597) who carried the gospel from Ireland to Scotland by way of Iona in A.D. 563. The name St. Columba is highly revered in northern Ireland; the Protestant cathedral in Londonderry was dedicated to him.\n\nCharles Stanford wrote an organ piece founded on the tune, in Six Short Preludes and Postludes, 1907, Opus 101, No. 6.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "This hymn on ecology and stewardship of the earth, after thanking God for all the beauty He created for us to enjoy, challenges our thinking. These lines, “We turn from our wasteful destruction of life” and “All nature around us is ours but on lease,” should prod us into a more caring attitude about the world around us.\n\nThe word prairies has been changed to meadows.\n\nWalter Henry Farquharson was born May 30, 1936, at Zealandia, near Rosetown, Saskatchewan, Canada. After study at his hometown high school, the University of Saskatchewan (where he obtained a B.A. in 1957), and St. Andrew’s College in Saskatoon, he was ordained in 1960 and went for a year of postgraduate study at Edinburgh, Scotland. Back at St. Andrew’s in 1961, he received the B.D. and became minister at Saltcoats (Saskatchewan) United Church and teacher of English at the local high school.\n\nThree of his hymns were included in The Hymn Book, Canada, 1971. A larger collection of his work appears in Worship the Lord, set to music by Ron Klusmeier, 1977. In a review of this book in the October 1978 issue of The Hymn, Kenneth W. Inkster says, “[Farquharson] has become our best Canadian writer of contemporary hymns. They allow all congregations to sing their faith and to celebrate the church’s involvement with the world. They breathe the spirit of Scripture as they express the thoughts of Christians in the 1970s.” The writer of more than 80 hymns and songs, he is at this writing (1986) involved in the preparation of a collection of teaching and worship songs for children. His interest in gardening and landscaping is reflected in this hymn.\n\nThe author says about this stewardship hymn: “The stewardship of the earth given to humankind calls forth a loving and creative response. All earth blossoms like Eden in the purposes of God. Men and women together tend the life that God has given them to enjoy in freedom and love.\n\n“To treasure all of life, this good earth with its rich resources, to love it and care for it, this is each gardener’s opportunity, calling, and joy. And we are all called to be God’s gardeners.”\n\nANNIVERSARY was written to celebrate the twenty-fifth birthday of Jane Marshall’s own congregation, Northaven United Methodist Church in Dallas, 1980. She was born in 1924, attended Highland Park School in Dallas, and earned B.Mus. and M.Mus. degrees at Southern Methodist University. At the latter institution she later served on the English, music, and seminary faculties. She has served as organist at First United Methodist Church in Corsicana, Texas, where she taught in the public schools; St. Andrew’s Presbyterian Church; Highland Park United Methodist Church; and Northaven United Methodist Church in Dallas. Her professional affiliations include membership on the Conference Board of Diaconal Ministry, United Methodist Church; the Fellowship of United Methodists in Worship, Music, and the Other Arts; Mu Phi Epsilon; Phi Kappa Lambda; the American Guild of Organists; and the American Choral Directors Association. She has also been a member of the board of directors of the Choristers Guild. In 1965 she received the Woman of Achievement Award from Southern Methodist University. She served as chairperson of the Hymn Supplement Task Force of the United Methodist Church. At this writing she is adjunct professor of church music at Perkins School of Theology at SMU.\n\nHer published works include many anthems for adult and children’s choirs, and she frequently writes for church music journals. In an article entitled “Approaches to Writing Hymn Tunes” in the April 1984 issue of The Hymn she says: “Writing a hymn tune is like shopping for art objects and then packing them all into one small suitcase to bring home. Selection and compression-choosing what to leave unbought and stuffing the rest into that tiny space is a dual process familiar to any composer, but the compression part of it has special urgency for writers of hymn tunes. To arrange it all so art arrives at its final destination ready to speak its powerful, evocative best in a fresh way with integrity is the goal, and many a handler has struggled into the wee hours before reaching it.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "In the early 1970s the Hymn Society of America sponsored a search for new hymns on the stewardship of the environment. This hymn by Fred Pratt Green (1903-; see Biographies) was selected and printed in a booklet of 16 hymns on this subject in 1973. It was also included in Ecumenical Praise, to the tune ECOLOGY by Austin Lovelace, and later in Hymns of the Saints, the hymnbook of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nA fifth stanza omitted is: Casual despoilers, or high-priests of Mammon, Selling the future for present rewards Careless of life and contemptuous of beauty: Bid them remember: the Earth is the Lord’s.\n\nSir Henry Walford Davies was a versatile musician, composer, munity singing. Born September 6, 1869, at Oswestry, Shropshire, En- choirmaster, adjudicator, teacher, editor, broadcaster, and pioneer of com- gland, he became a chorister at St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle and later assistant to the organist. Earning in 1898 the D. Mus. at Cambridge University, he was appointed organist at Temple Church, London, where he stayed for 25 years. Going to the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, in 1919, he was professor of music for several years and was knighted by King George Vin 1922. It was there that he wrote this tune WALLOG, while conducting experiments in cooperative hymn writing with his students. The tune was first published in his A Student’s Hymnal, 1928. It has not been used by other British hymnals but appears in the 1937 edition of the Christian Science Hymnal.\n\nDavies’ final post was at St. George’s Chapel, where he began as a chorister; he succeeded Sir Edward Elgar as Master of the king’s music in 1934. He assisted in editing several hymnbooks; he wrote The Pursuit of Music, 1935, and with Harvey Grace wrote Music and Christian Worship, 1928. His compositions include hymn tunes; an oratorio, The Temple; and several cantatas. But his most notable contribution was, no doubt, his broadcasts on the BBC, in which he excelled at music education on radio. His series Melodies in Christendom helped the listeners to a new appreciation of the beauty of hymnody. He died March 11, 1941.\n\nDavies’ other tune in SDAH is GOD BE IN MY HEAD, No. 678.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "We are indebted to William J. Reynolds, is editor of the Baptist Hymnal, 1975, for this hymn. The following account of how it was written is from his Companion to the Baptist Hymnal, 1976:\n\n“Hugh T. McElrath wrote this hymn in the summer of 1962. He provides this information: ‘I was sitting at my studio desk trying to focus my attention on some research that needed completion. My mind wandered; my interest lagged, and my thoughts kept turning to formulating some verses to fit the appealing Irish tune CLONMEL, which I had recently come to know and love. Being a teacher charged with the task of challenging minds, I was imbued with the idea of praising God with the mind as well as every other part of one’s being. Taking Mark 12:30 as my inspiration and guide, I wrote all three stanzas of the hymn during the course of that afternoon. At first having no thought of submitting the hymn in a competition, I later revised it slightly and sent it in to the Southern Baptist Hymn Writing Competition of 1962, where it received honorable mention.'”\n\nHugh Thomas McElrath was born March 1, 1932, at Murray, Kentucky. He was educated at Murray State University; Southern Baptist Theological Seminary; and a conservatory in Bologna, Italy. He finally earned the Ph.D. at Eastman School of Music, University of Rochester, New York. In 1948 he began teaching at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, guiding students in voice, musicology, hymnology, and worship. He has written significant articles on these subjects for a number of journals, and was a member of Subcommittee III: Theological and Doctrinal Evaluation for the Baptist Hymnal, 1975.\n\nCLONMEL (named after a small town in County Tipperary, Ireland) is Irish folk song known as “The Flight of the Earls.” It first appeared as a hymn tune in the Church and School Hymnal, London, 1926. Reynolds first made the arrangement as a unison anthem for children, and then the hymn tune version for the Baptist Hymnal, 1975.\n\nWilliam Jensen Reynolds was born April 2, 1920 at Atlantic, Iowa. When he was five months old, his parents moved to Oklahoma, where his father was a church music director and evangelistic singer. He was educated at Oklahoma Baptist University, Southwest Missouri State University, Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, North Texas State University (M.M.), and Westminster Choir College. In 1961 George Peabody College for Teachers conferred on him the Ed.D.\n\nAfter serving as minister of music in several Oklahoma churches, he joined the Church Music Department of the Baptist Sunday School Board, Nashville, Tennessee, in 1955, and helped to develop church music programs in some 33,000 Southern Baptist churches. A composer and arranger of choral music, hymns, anthems, and cantatas, he became head of the department in 1971. He is the author of A Survey of Christian Hymnody, 1963; Christ and the Carols, 1967; and Congregational Singing, 1975. Besides chairing the committee for Baptist Hymnal, 1975, and authoring Companion to the Baptist Hymnal, 1976, he had the distinction of having written the companion 12 years earlier for the previous Baptist Hymnal, 1956, titled for two hymns, eight original tunes, and four arrangements. He has served as music director for meetings of the Southern Baptist Convention and other national and international convocations. He has been very active in the Hymn Society of America, serving as its president in 1977. Presently he teaches in the School of Church Music, Southwestern Theological Seminary, Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

But in 1931, when Songs of Praise was published, a new, more vigorous tune, CHARING, was composed for the text by Studley Leslie Lane Russell. He was born July 7, 1901, in Staines, Middlesex, England, and studied at Clifton College, Christ Church, Oxford, where he held a scholarship in organ, and at the Royal College of Music, where he studied viola, piano, and composition. His work in the latter was so outstanding that he won the Octavia traveling scholarship, which enabled him to go to Vienna for advanced work. Back in England, he became director of music at Sutton Valence School in Kent. He died in 1978.\n\nCHARING is named for a town about eight miles from the village of Sutton Valence.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "Seventh-day Adventists have always taken seriously the charge of Jesus to the disciples, “Heal the sick” (Matt. 10:8). The church places much emphasis on healthful living; it has medical facilities all over the world, staffed by thousands of dedicated doctors, nurses, and medical technicians. The hymnal committee was most gratified to find this special hymn for those engaged in the healing arts.\n\nThis hymn’s opening line was “Father, whose will is life and good,” and it first appeared in A Missionary Hymn Book, 1922, published in London by the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge.\n\nHardwicke Drummond Rawnsley was born September 28, 1851, the son of an Anglican minister at Shiplake, Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, England. Educated at Balliol College, Oxford, he was ordained in 1875 and held the following positions: curate of St. Barnabas’, Bristol; vicar at Low Wray, Lancashire; vicar at Crosthwaite; and honorary canon of Carlisle. He published several books of poetry and a few hymns. A lifelong lover of nature, he organized the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest, and published 12 books on the beauty of the English Lake District. He died May 28, 1920, in the district of Grasmere.\n\nBISHOPTHORPE was probably written by Jeremiah Clark (1669- 1707; see SDAH 19), the great organist of St. Paul’s Cathedral in London. Its earliest appearance in print was in H. Gardner’s Select Portions of the Psalms of David (undated, the second edition appeared in 1786). After some melody changes, it was in The Psalms of David for the Use of the Parish Churches. The Music Selected, Adapted, and Composed by Edward Miller, Mus. Doc., 1790. It was the setting for Psalm 15. So it could have been adapted or even originally composed by Miller, but most hymnals give credit to Clark.\n\nSDAH has another tune by Clark, ST. MAGNUS, which SDAH uses twice, at No. 19 and 199.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "historicalContext": "Daniel Crane Roberts was born November 5, 1841, on Long Island, New York. He graduated in 1857 from Kenyon College, Gambier, Ohio, and then served in the Civil War. He studied for the ministry and was ordained deacon in 1865, and priest in 1866. He served in Protestant Episcopal churches in Vermont and Massachusetts, and for 23 years as vicar of St. Paul’s, Concord, New Hampshire. He was president of the New Hampshire State Historical Society and received an honorary D.D. in 1885 from Norwich University. He died in Concord on October 31, 1907. While he was ministering in Brandon, Vermont, he wrote this hymn for the Fourth of July centennial celebrations in 1876. This patriotic hymn calls for the great Creator of the starry heavens to exercise similar guidance over His people, protecting them from war and disease and making His grace appear in their lives.\n\nNATIONAL HYMN was written for these words in 1892 by the self-taught but accomplished organist George William Warren at the special request of Dr. J. Ireland Tucker. It was included in Tucker’s Hymnal 1892. The name is appropriate, for the words commemorate the American Independence Day. Notice that the last line of the melody is, with two repeated notes, a complete descending octave.\n\nWarren composed church music, anthems, hymn tunes and piano pieces. He was born August 17, 1828, in Albany, New York. He was organist at St. Peter’s, Albany, from 1846 to 1858; at St. Paul’s, in the same city, from 1858 to 1860, at Holy Trinity, Brooklyn, from 1860 to 1870; and finally at St. Thomas’, New York City, from 1870 to 1900. He was honored for his services to music by Racine College, Wisconsin, with the degree of D.Mus. He died in New York City on March 17, 1902.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "An anonymous hymn in Latin entitled “Gloriosi Salvatoris” (“of the glorious Savior”), it comes from the Antwerp Breviary, 1446, and the Meissen Breviary, Liege, C. 1510. John M. Neale (1818-1866; see Biographies), who translated it in his Mediaeval Hymns, 1851, claimed that it was the first rendering in English and said concerning the original, “A German hymn on the Festival of the Holy Name of Jesus.” It is based on Acts 4:12, “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.”\n\nThe version SDAH uses was adapted by Robert F. Neill and printed in the New Saint Basil Hymnal. This version, however, is a translation of the first line only of the original hymn, which directs the rulers of the nations to settle their differences by humbly submitting to the King of kings. The remaining five stanzas enlarge on the different aspects of the name of Jesus: name of gladness, name of adoration, name of music and wisdom, name exalted and strong, and finally a name to be written in the heart. The present hymn is therefore not to be credited to Neale, except the first line only.\n\nWhile it is basically a hymn extolling the name of Jesus, the language forcefully reminds us that ideally the rulers of the nations could profit by giving their allegiance to “Christ the head.”\n\nST. LEONARD is a typical German chorale of the late seventeenth century, most often attributed to Johann Christoph Bach, the second cousin of the great J. S. Bach. It was printed in Neuvermehrtes Meiningisches Gesangbuch (New Enlarged Meiningen Hymnal), 1693, and later taken up by many other German collections.\n\nJohann Christoph Bach was born December 8, 1642, at Arnstadt, near Erfurt, now East Germany. At the age of 23 he became organist at Eisenach, and stayed there until his death on March 31, 1703, 38 years later. He was bold for his time in the use of daring harmonies, and he excelled in writing vocal music. A setting he made of Revelation 12:7-12 for two choirs of five voices each, plus strings, bassoon, trumpets, tympani, and organ, was performed by J. S. Bach at Leipzig on a scale that profoundly impressed his peers.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "authorBirthDeath": "1819–1910",
    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": 1861,
    "historicalContext": "Julia Ward Howe, a Unitarian, was born May 27, 1819, in New York but live later in Boston. She was a pioneer in women’s right and the abolition of slavery, a poet as well as a campaigner for prison reform and world peace. She preached occasionally in Unitarian Churches. In 1848 she married S. G. Howe, who had similar ideas and interests. Julia Howe wrote several books and collections of verse. She died October 17, 1910, at Newport, Rhode Island. In the April 1976 issue (official organ of the Hymn Society of America) T. J. Trimborn tells this story of how the hymn came to be written:\n\n“On November 20, 1861, one of many Union troop reviews held during the Civil War took place at Baileys Crossroads, Virginia, a short distance from Washington. President Abraham Lincoln, Cabinet officers, diplomats, other dignitaries with their wives and families, and 25,000 spectators were in attendance to review the assembled regiments..\n\n“That night one of the multitude of spectators did not sleep well, and in her reminiscences wrote why. ‘On the return from the review of troops near the city, to beguile the rather tedious drive we sang from time to time snatches of the army songs so popular at that time, concluding I think with “John Brown’s Body” [a song about a militant abolitionist hanged in Charles Town for his fight against slavery].’ The Reverend James Clarke, who had accompanied the woman and her husband that day, suggested that she write some words more suitable for the stirring tune. And so it was that that night this chance remark kept coming back to her mind. Finally she arose from bed, found in the dimness an old stump of a pen, and without hesitation scrawled several verses almost without looking at the paper. Julia Ward Howe had realized the inspiration for a song-music which would later touch President Lincoln deeply and stir the hearts of a whole people to become not merely a timely melody but a national musical treasure.’\n\nIn 1864 President Lincoln attended the second anniversary meeting of the Christian Commission (a volunteer organization that gathered food and supplies for and gave medical help to combat soldiers), held in the House of Representatives. After many speeches, the “singing Methodist chaplain,” Charles C. McCabe, told a chilling account of his capture and imprisonment in the Confederate Libby Prison at Richmond, Virginia, and closed by singing this song, which he had taught to the other prisoners; “Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.” When he got to the chorus, “Glory! glory! Hallelujah!” the entire audience and band joined in. Before the last notes died away, a voice was heard; “Sing it again!” It was the voice of none other than President Lincoln. “The Battle Hymn” was duly repeated with great fervor, Mr. Lincoln standing, his voice raised in song, tears streaming down his cheeks, obviously very moved.\n\nThe tune BATTLE HYMN, so named for its use by the Yankee soldiers in the Civil War, was in constant use for a number of texts long before the Civil War, including the camp meeting song, “Say, Brothers, Will You Meet Us.” It has been claimed by William Steffe, organist and choirmaster of camp meeting festivals, who probably borrowed it from an earlier secular song melody composed by a Philadelphia musician.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "translator": "",
    "yearWritten": 1918,
    "historicalContext": "Because of the many countries served by SDAH, the committee decided not to include the specific patriotic hymns of each, but rather to have a few hymns that could be sung with fervor in any country. This one is unique in that the first stanza pledges loyalty to an earthly country and the second gives allegiance to the kingdom of God we all look forward to. Sir Valentine Chirol wrote a Memoir of Spring-Rice, in which appears this account of the origin of these lines: “Written on January 12, 1918, by Sir Cecil Arthur Spring-Rice, His Majesty’s ambassador to the United States, on the eve of his final departure from Washington. The vow recorded in them had been kept long before he put it into words, for he had served his country for a quarter of a century with the ‘love that never falters’; and, though he knew it not, he was already a dying man.” He died the very next night, January 13, 1918, in Ottawa, Canada.\n\nAfter the announcement that he was leaving Washington, Spring-Rice received a letter from William Jennings Bryan, whom he very much admired. In his answer he said: “I have been reading your ‘Heart to Heart Appeals’ with great profit and satisfaction, and they have inspired me with some lines which I venture to enclose-as a sort of spontaneous outpouring. These two stanzas follow. As a hymn, it was included in several British hymnals, but to our knowledge this is the first time it has been used in the United States.\n\nCecil Arthur Spring-Rice was born February 27, 1859, in London, educated at Eton and Balliol, and was a secretary and clerk in the War and Foreign offices. He was knighted in 1908. He held posts as a diplomat in Brussels, Teheran, Cairo, St. Petersburg, and Sweden. From 1912 to 1918 he was ambassador to the United States. Of him Theodore Roosevelt said: “Only a man of rare unselfishness, a man completely lacking in the vulgar ambition to keep in the public eye, could in this crisis have rendered the literally invaluable service that his country-and my country, too-needed, and that Cecil rendered” (Stephen Gwynn, Letters and Friendships of Sir Cecil Spring-Rice, 1929). Poems, a book of his works, was published in 1920 after his death.\n\nTHAXTED, named for a village in Essex that boasts a seventeenth- century guild hall and a famous church, was composed by Gustav Holst (1874-1934; see SDAH 224). It is an arrangement from the melody of the Jupiter section of his major orchestral suite, The Planets. It has been characterized by Archibald Jacob in Songs of Praise Discussed, 1933, as a tune with an “Irish” flavor. One note has been altered-the final note at the end of the second score in the original goes down to a low F.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "The early years of the nineteenth century in England were filled with fear because of the constant threat of invasion by the armies of emperor Napoleon, who had brought virtually the rest of Europe under his rule. When he was finally defeated in 1815 at the battle of Waterloo and exiled, the alarms of war were removed. However, a few years later, in 1837, the young queen Victoria, an inexperienced girl of only 18 years, succeeded to the throne amid fears lest she would be unequal to her task. The words of this hymn were then written as a national hymn of prayer for England by the Unitarian minister, John Reynell Wreford.\n\nWreford was born December 12, 1800, at Barnstaple, a manufacturing town and seaport of northwest Devonshire, England. He was educated at Manchester College, Yorkshire, to be trained for the Unitarian ministry. In 1826 he was appointed copastor of the New Meeting, Birmingham. After five years in the ministry he was compelled to resign because of the failure of his voice. He thereupon opened a school in Edgbaston, a suburb of the city of Birmingham. He translated an essay on the divine origin of the Old Testament, published a history of nonconformity in Birmingham, and Lays of Loyalty in celebration of the accession of the queen in 1837. He also wrote several volumes of verse, mostly of a devotional nature, and contributed 55 original hymns to Beard’s Collection of Hymns, 1837. He retired to Bristol and died July 2, 1881, at St. Marylebone, London.\n\nThe tune DUNFERMLINE, which is the name of the town in Fifeshire that was the ancient capital of Scotland, first appeared in 1615 in the Scottish Psalter as one of the 12 common tunes to which most of the psalms are sung.\n\nIts composition has been attributed to John Angus, the precentor of Dunfermline Abbey at the time of the Reformation.\n\nIn his Whole Booke of Psalmes, 1621, Ravenscroft named it Dunfermline Tune and set it to Psalm 89. Note that the final two measures are a fifth below the melody of the final two measures of the first score.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "yearWritten": null,
    "historicalContext": "The first stanza of this hymn, especially written for families and praising love in the home, comes from Ephesians 3:14,15: “For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named.” Written in 1939 and printed first in 6.6.6.6.8.8. meter in the 1940 Report of the Joint Committee on the Revision of the Hymnal (Episcopal), Tucker changed the meter to fit the tune RHOSYMEDRE. It was then voted into the Hymnal 1940.\n\nFrancis Bland Tucker was born on January 6, 1895, the son of an Episcopalian bishop, at Norfolk, Virginia. His college work was at University of Virginia. At Virginia Theological Seminary he earned the B.D. in 1920 and the D.D. in 1944. After service in a hospital during World War I, he was ordained and served churches in Virginia and Washington, D.C. In 1945 he accepted a call to Christ Church, Savannah, Georgia, following in the footsteps John Wesley made there 210 years before. Tucker remained there until retirement in 1967.\n\nHe was a member of the committee for the hymnal noted above and was the only living member of that committee when work was begun on the Episcopal Hymnal 1982 (which was published in 1985). As a valued working member of that committee also, he was honored by this resolution in 1982: “His octogenarian vigor, seasoned humor, and artistic wisdom have been an inspiration to all with whom he has worked. He has been in our midst as a living symbol of the richness of our Anglican heritage, and of the high calling to preserve and enhance our praise of God through hymns.” Six of his hymns were in the Hymnal 1940, and a like number, plus some revisions and extra stanzas, in the Hymnal 1982.\n\nWhen he retired, his parish gave him the rectory to live in for life. He loved to tease them with, “You never anticipated that I’d last so long!” It was in this beautiful 1853 house in Savannah’s historic district that he hosted the final meeting of the text committee for the Hymnal, 1982. At his funeral on January 4, 1984, eight great hymns were sung by the congregation, including “Our Father, by Whose Name.”\n\nThe tune RHOSYMEDRE was originally called LOVELY and ended with an extended “Hallelujah!” It was in John Edwards’ Original Sacred Music, published about 1840. John David Edwards was born December 19, 1805 or 1806, at Penderlyngoch, Cardiganshire, Wales, and graduated from Jesus College, Oxford. He became a deacon in 1820 and a priest in 1832. He ministered in the town of Rhosymedre, in North Wales, for many years, and died November 24, 1885. He wrote quite a bit of music, but this tune is best remembered. In many hymnals it is used with the text “My Song Is Love Unknown,” by Samuel Crossman (see SDAH 188), for which SDAH indicates RHOSYMEDRE as an alternate tune.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Spitta wrote this hymn about the home and family in 1826 and published it in his Psalter und Harfe, 1833, in five eight-line stanzas titled “Salvation is come to this house” (Luke 19:9). The translation from the German by Honor Mary Thwaites was made for the ecumenical Australian Hymn Book, 1977.\n\nKarl Johann Philipp Spitta was born August 1, 1801, at Hannover, Germany. At age 11 he was apprenticed to a watchmaker, but he intensely disliked watchmaking. Finally the opportunity came for him to go to the University of Göttingen, where he finished in 1824. After ordination he pastored the Lutheran church at Sudwalde, served as a military chaplain, and in 1847 was instituted as Lutheran superintendent at Wittingen. Before his death of a heart attack while writing at his desk, September 28, 1859, he also served at Peine and Burgdorf. He began writing poetry at age 8, and while at the university wrote secular pieces. Near the end of his school work there, a new spiritual experience led him to quit secular writing. He wrote to a friend, “In the manner in which I formerly sang, I sing no more. To the Lord I consecrate my life and my love, and likewise my song. His love is the one great theme of all my songs; to praise and exalt it worthily is the desire of the Christian singer. He gave to me song and melody; I give it back to Him.”\n\nHis book of hymns became very popular in Germany; many translators have shown their appreciation, as evidenced by a list nearly two pages long in Julian’s Dictionary of Hymnology, of those that have been translated. Numerous musical settings have also been made for Spitta’s poetry, which was written for private devotional and family use.\n\nHonor Mary Thwaites was born September 21, 1914, at Young, New South Wales, Australia. She was the daughter of a family doctor and elder of the Presbyterian Church. She studied French and German at the University of Melbourne, Australia, receiving a B.A. with honors. While a student there, she made a lifelong commitment to the Christian faith. Just prior to World War II she worked in London with the Society of Friends Committee to help “non Aryan” Christians escape from countries ruled by the Nazis. Back in Australia, she became an Anglican; she now lives in Canberra with her husband and is a member of the church of St. John the Baptist.\n\nWELWYN, a Welsh word pronounced “well-in,” was first printed in Arundel Hymns, 1902. Ralph Vaughan Williams used it in the 1906 English Hymnal altering the present rhythm of the beginning of line 3 to fit the text “O Perfect Love, All Human Thought Transcending,” which has the same meter as “Happy the Home.”\n\nSir Alfred Scott-Gatty was born April 26, 1847, at Ecclesfield, York- shire, England, where his father was subdean of the great York Minster (Cathedral). By a royal license, Alfred assumed as an additional surname his mother’s name Scott. Her father, a minister also, had been private secretary to Lord Nelson. Alfred spent his life as a specialist in heraldry; he held a number of official posts in this line, the last one as Garter Principal King of Arms. On his appointment to this office in 1904, he was knighted. Interested in music all his life, he published (with his poet mother) several books of children’s songs and hundreds of popular humorous and sentimental songs. He died at St. Marylebone, London, December 18, 1918.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

He really captured the essence of how to have peace around the house — just how plenty of love! The Mormons have made good use of this hymn in their emphasis on the value of the family unit in stabilizing society.\n\nThe hymn was first printed in the American Sunday School Hymnbook, published in Philadelphia by the American Sunday School Union in 1860. More than 100 hymnals included it from that year to 1973.\n\nOne Scripture reference seems to sum up the message of this hymn is John 13:35: “By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

It was composed by Franklin Edson Belden (1858-1945; see Biographies). The words appeared in Hymns and Tunes, 1886, with another tune, but in Christ in Song, 1908, Belden used this tune, which he had copyrighted in 1886, naming it DOANE (no doubt after the prolific gospel song composer). The name ROBINSON was used for the tune by the editors of Church Hymnal, 1941.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "This text was written by Presbyterian minister Frank von Christierson (1900-; see SDAH 556) to be sung to the tune O PERFECT LOVE (SDAH 656). The Hymnal of the United Church of Christ was the first book to wed it to the tune CHARTERHOUSE. It is a thoughtful prayer that can be sung in family worship, and it would be appropriate for the congregation to sing at weddings. Not many hymns call for more laughter in the home, and most will agree that we need more of that. His third stanza brings us face to face with the embarrassing fact that we hurt those we love most; “Forgive the hurts our selfishness inflicted on those we love and those who love us best.”\n\nCHARTERHOUSE was composed by David Evans (1874-1948; see Biographies) for the text “O Son of Man, Our Hero Strong and Tender.” It was printed first in the English Church Hymnary, 1927. The name comes from Charterhouse School, London, which moved to Godalming, Surrey, in 1872. The headmaster at the time, Frank Fletcher, wrote the above- mentioned text. In 1611 one Thomas Sutton bought the old Carthusian Monastery of 1371 and endowed a hospital and school to take care of 80 pensioners (“decayed gentlemen”) and educate 42 poor boys. Among several who went to school here and later attained fame were John Wesley and Joseph Addison.\n\nThe broadly sweeping melody found its place in many English hymnals and was brought to America in the Episcopal The Hymnal 1940.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "yearWritten": 1883,
    "historicalContext": "One Sunday evening in 1883 the two Blomfield sisters and some friends were singing hymns together in the Blomfield home at Wyke, Windermere, Cumberland. One of them was shortly to be married to Hugh Redmayne, and naturally the thoughts of the company turned to a hymn for the wedding. The prospective bride had a favorite tune, STRENGTH AND STAY, composed by John Bacchus Dykes (see Biographies), but it was pointed out that the words accompanying this tune were rather inappropriate for a wedding, as one line refers to “the brightness of a holy deathbed”! Whereupon the bride-to-be asked what was the use of having a poet for a sister if she could not write suitable words for her favorite tune. So Dorothy Frances Blomfield repaired to the quiet of the library and returned with the words of this hymn in the short space of 15 minutes. She said that once she had conceived the initial idea of love and life, it was no effort to compose the lines. The company all sung it together, and it was chosen for the wedding.\n\nDorothy Blomfield was born at Finsbury Circus, London, on October 4, 1858. She married an Anglican minister, Gerald Gurney, in 1897, and both were received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1919. She wrote two volumes of verse. She died at Notting Hill, Kensington, London, on June 15, 1932.\n\nDykes’ original tune has been displaced by the present O PERFECT LOVE, or SANDRINGHAM, composed by Joseph Barnby (1838-1896; see Biographies). Its first name comes from the opening words of the hymn for which it was written. Its second stems from the fact that the tune is an arrangement from an anthem specially written for the marriage of Princess Louise, sister of King George V, to the duke of Fife on July 27, 1889. Sandringham is one of the royal residences in Norfolk.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

Fred Kaan has added this one to our wedding repertoire, a thoughtful prayer for the bridal pair. It was written in 1965 during his ministry in Plymouth and appears in Pilgrim Praise, 1967.\n\nMelvin West (1930-; see Biographies) has given us a smoothly flowing tune that, while “romantic” in style, still maintains the dignity desired for this sacred service.

The Hymnal Companion is the source of the information on this hymn and tune. This lovely hymn is a song for the congregation; it is a fervent prayer for God’s blessing on the couple.\n\nBarbara Adam was born June 21, 1939, in Evanston, Illinois.

Later they moved to Swift Current, where she directs the junior choir at the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Canada. Besides teaching piano and directing children’s choirs, she has produced a significant body of published devotional material.\n\nNAME OF JESUS was first composed for the text “Jesus, Name All Names Above,” and appeared in the Lutheran Service Book and Hymnal, 1958. The third score is most attractive in the way the composer uses melodic and harmonic sequences to go into the key of F, and then in just three chords back to the home key of D flat.\n\nRalph Alvin Strom was born October 31, 1901, at St. Paul, Minnesota. He attended Augsburg College, University of Minnesota, and St. Olaf College, Minneapolis College of Music, receiving his Doctorate in 1974. His career, spanning the years 1941 to 1972, included teaching in high school and organist-choirmaster at several Lutheran churches in Minnesota. Active in community affairs, he founded the Bethesda Hospital Nurses’ Choir in 1926 and directed it for 46 years. He composed a number of anthems and hymn tunes, four of which were included in The Hymnal, 1925, of the Augustana Synod, Lutheran Church. He died January 25, 1977.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "historicalContext": "This is a metrical paraphrase by John Newton (1725-1807; see Biographies) of 2 Corinthians 13:14: “The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all.” He wrote it to be sung as a benediction after the sermon; it was printed in Olney Hymns, 1779. The original was a single stanza of eight lines, which has been made into two stanzas. Newton included himself with the congregation in this benediction and wrote “us” instead of “them” and “we” where SDAH has “they.” This present version is most appropriate for the congregation to sing at the marriage ceremony.\n\nSTUTTGART was first published in Psalmodia Sacra, 1715, by A. C. Ludwig and Christian Friedrich Witt. It was probably composed or arranged by the latter. The original melody contained some florid grace notes; this simpler adaptation was made by Henry J. Gauntlett (1805-1876; see SDAH 149) for the text “Earth has many a noble city” and included in the 1861 Hymns Ancient and Modern. The tune name is unusual in that most of the German chorales are identified by the first line of the text.\n\nChristian Friedrich Witt (c. 1660-1716), the son of a court organist, also became a court organist at Gotha, in Germany, in 1868, and music director at his birthplace, Altenburg, in 1713.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "This lesser doxology, as it is called, or in Latin, Gloria Patri (Glory to the Father) is of great antiquity in the Christian church, going back at least to the second century A.D. for the first part. The second half was added perhaps four centuries later. The Trinitarian ascription derives from Matthew 28:19, “in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.” A text of Scripture that mentions glory with two persons of the Godhead is Ephesians 3:21, “Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.”\n\nThe musical setting, GLORIA PATRI, is taken from Henry Wellington Greatorex’s Collection of Psalm and Hymn Tunes, 1851. Another tune from this collection by Greatorex is MANOAH, SDAH 315. Greatorex (1813- 1858) also arranged SDAH 48, SEYMOUR.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "This transcription by Wayne Hooper (1920-; see Biographies) is taken from an anthem published by Plymouth Music Co., New York. It was number five (The Sanctus) in a series of eight short choral pieces that made up the German Mass written by Schubert in 1827 at the age of 30, one year before his death. The mass was scored for mixed voices with woodwinds, horns, trombones, timpani, and organ, the instruments doubling the voices in simple chorale style. No information is available on John Philipp Neumann, who wrote the German text, or Charles H. Davis, who translated it into English for the anthem. The scripture referred to is “Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come” (Rev. 4:8).\n\nFranz Peter Schubert was born January 31, 1797, in Vienna in a modest house that is now maintained as a museum. His father was a schoolmaster and taught him violin; piano instruction came from his older brother, Ignaz. Michael Holzer, a local church musician, taught him singing, harmony, counterpoint, and organ playing. He soon outstripped all of them, and Holzer commented: “If I wished to instruct him in anything fresh, he already knew it. Consequently I gave him no actual tuition but merely talked to him, and watched him with silent astonishment!” Later, while studying at the Imperial and Royal Seminary, Schubert played first violin in the orchestra and even conducted when the master was away. Wenzel Ruzicka, his teacher, said of his rare ability, “He has learnt it from God, that lad.” At age 16 he left the seminary and took a training course for school teachers, and went to assist at his father’s school. But this was not his talent. Composing music became a consuming passion, and he soon gave up teaching to spend full time at it. Although he and Beethoven lived in musical Vienna at the same time, Schubert met the older man only once, on his death bed. Beethoven was given some 60 of the young man’s songs; after reading them through silently, he said, “Truly in Schubert there is a divine spark.”\n\nSchubert was amazingly prolific; 20 full pages in Grove’s Dictionary of Music and Musicians are taken just to list his compositions, which include operas, stage music, church music, choral pieces with orchestra, overtures and symphonies, chamber music, works for violin and piano, and hundreds of songs. Schubert started composing at age 13 and ended only a short time before his death on November 19, 1828, from typhoid, at age 31. His prodigious output has been called “an outburst of composition without parallel in the annals of music: in sheer bulk alone this music would dwarf the output of the most industrious student, and industry alone could not account for it. The means of self-expression had been acquired, and his genius sought untiringly for utterance.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

It is preceded by a prayer before the sacred elements are brought into the sanctuary. Gerard Moultrie translated this prayer of the fifth century from the Greek in 1864, making of it a four-stanza hymn.\n\nMoultrie was born in Rugby, Warwickshire, on September 16, 1829. He studied at the University of Oxford, gaining a B.A. degree in 1851 and an M.A. degree in 1856. He was ordained in 1852 and was appointed chaplain and master at Shrewsbury school. He was chaplain to the Marchio- ness of Londonderry from 1855 to 1859; curate at Brightwalton for a year; and from 1860 to 1864 at Brinfield (both villages in Hertfordshire). For the next five years he was chaplain in the benefice of Barrow Gurney, Bristol, and then vicar of Southleigh, near Oxford, in 1869. He wrote several original hymns and translated many from Greek, Latin, and German, making a specialty of topics untouched by other hymnwriters. He died at Southleigh on April 25, 1885.\n\nThe melody PICARDY is a seventeenth-century French carol, possibly older. It came from the Picardy district of northern France, but is first found in print in 1860 in Chansons populaires des provinces de France (Popular Songs of French Provinces).\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "Let it be so,” “true,” “faithful,” “certain,” “surely,” “indeed,” are some of the shades of meaning of this word. In the Old Testament, “amen” appears as an affirmation assenting to a proclamation (as in Deuteronomy 27:15-26), and as a response to psalms chanted in the Temple service (as in Psalm 41:13). In the New Testament, “amen” commonly follows a doxology, or ascription of praise to God (as in Romans 11:36). It is also used as a closing word for several of the epistles. In Psalm 106:48, all the people are admonished to join in giving this affirmation: “Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the Lord.”\n\nIn some hymnbooks, there is an amen at the end of each hymn. The committee chose not to follow this plan but to print a few that could be sung by choir or congregation wherever needed in the service to give affirmation or emphasis. James Moffatt once said that “the amen is like signing one’s name to a document, not a thing to be done casually.”\n\nA. The Dresden Amen has been extracted from the Threefold Amen of  the Royal Chapel of Dresden. It was written by J. G. Naumann (1741-1801), who spent all of his life in this part of Saxony, Germany. This same melody is in Mendelssohn’s Symphony No. 5 (Reformation); Richard Wagner used it also in his Parsifal.\n\nB. Robert Ramsay (c. 1600-c. 1650) was organist at Trinity College, Cambridge, England, 1628-1644; and choral director, 1637-1644. He is known as a composer of Morning and Evening Services in F, two anthems, and other church music.\n\nC, D, and E. Melvin West, (1930-; see Biographies) the chairman of the tunes subcommittee for SDAH, composed these three amens at the request of the committee for something a little more contemporary in sound.\n\nF. Hymnbook editors seem to be unanimous in calling this amen “Danish,” but there is no information available that might give us a reason why.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

E. Belden’s (see Biographies) Christ in Song: “The Lord’s Prayer,” “The Beatitudes,” “The Doxology,” and a thanks to be sung at meals.\n\nIn the Hymnal for Youth, 1950, printed by the Presbyterian Westminster Press, Philadelphia, this offertory sentence appears exactly as SDAH has it, and credit is given for the music to Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827). This book was edited by Calvin Laufer and Lawrence Curry, two noted musicians and hymnologists in the Presbyterian Church. Leonard Ellinwood, highly respected Episcopal hymnologist, says, “Obviously Beethoven did not write it in the form we sing. I spent quite a bit of time, 40 years ago, searching through Beethoven’s complete works, to no avail. Our Hymnal 1940 wisely called it ‘anonymous.’\n\nAccording to the Dictionary of American Hymnology’s first-line index, its first occurrence in a hymnal was in F. E. Belden’s Songs for the King’s Business, published by the Sunday School Supply House, Chicago, 1909.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

In Church Hymnal, 1941, it was printed minus the closing Amens, which have now been restored.\n\nBorn March 27, 1858, of Danish parents at Thompsonville, Wisconsin, Lutkin attended the choir school at St. James’ Church in Chicago and at age 14 was chosen the organist there. After three years of study in Europe, he returned to Chicago at age 26 to be organist/choirmaster at St. Clements’ from 1884 to 1891, and back at St. James’ until 1896. Syracuse University awarded him the D.Mus. degree in 1900. He taught theory at the American Conservatory, then in 1896 founded and became dean of the school of music at Northwestern University. His a cappella choir, begun in 1906, established a tradition of excellence long emulated by others.\n\nHe helped to found the American Guild of Organists, and was president of the Music Teacher’s National Association in 1911 and 1920. He served on the hymnal commissions of both the Episcopal and Methodist churches. He composed anthems, choral pieces, hymn tunes, and instrumental music. Death came at Evanston, Illinois, on December 27, 1931, while he was working on a new hymnal. He was the musical editor of the Methodist Hymnal, 1905. Lutkin Hall at Northwestern University perpetuates memory.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "Evangelist Roy Allan Anderson, for many year years secretary of the Ministerial Department, General Conference of SDA, introduced this beautiful chorus in a Week of Prayer at La Sierra College about 1939. He arranged it, changing the melody somewhat, and included it in Gospel Melodies, 1944, with a copyright by the Review and Herald. This is a case where a piece of music found its way into wide use without proper recognition of its source. William J. Reynolds, in Companion to the Baptist Hymnal, 1976, gives us the full story. In 1926, Daniel Iverson, a Presbyterian minister from Lumberton, North Carolina, attended a citywide revival conducted by the George T. Stephens evangelistic party in by a message on the Holy Spirit given by Dr. Barron, a physician from a tabernacle in Orlando, Florida. While there, he was greatly impressed Columbia, South Carolina. That same day he went to the local Presbyterian church, found a piano, and wrote the words and music of this and E. Powell Lee, the song leader, taught it to the crowd that night and continued to use it through the meetings. It was printed on single song sheets and found its way to revivals and church services everywhere. In 1929 Robert H. Coleman printed it (without Iverson’s name) in his Revival Songs with the line “Arr. by E. L. Wolslagel.” The original melody was changed, repeating measures 1 and 2 in measures 5 and 6. In 1937 it appeared again in Songs of Victory, marked “Arr. by B. B. McKinney” and with the title, “Fall Fresh on Me.” The melody here is the same as Wolslagel’s, but the harmony is different, and Iverson was not given credit. The error was compounded when this version was included in the 1940 Broadman Hymnal and in the first printings of Baptist Hymnal, 1956. In the early 1960s, the song leader who first taught it to a crowd, E. Powell Lee, brought the matter to Reynold’s attention, and in subsequent printings of Baptist Hymnal Iverson was given credit.\n\nThe SDAH committee chose to go back to the stronger melody of Iverson’s original, with harmony arrangement by Melvin West (1930-; see Biographies).\n\nDaniel Iverson was born September 26, 1890, in Brunswick, Georgia, and educated at University of Georgia, Moody Bible Institute, Columbia Theological Seminary, and the University of South Carolina. Ordained in 1914, he served Presbyterian churches in Georgia and North and South Carolina. In 1927 he organized the Shenandoah Presbyterian Church in Miami, Florida, and was its pastor for 24 years until retirement in 1951. During this period he was recognized as a powerful preacher and evangelist. In 1962 he moved to Asheville, North Carolina, and continues to preach in pulpits where needed.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

Lorayne was born July 11, 1919 to Seventh-day Adventist missionary parents in Shanghai, China. Her father, Dr. H. O. Swartout, was the author of The Modern Medical Counselor, sold by many student colporteurs to finance college education. Back in California, he served as chief public health officer of San Luis Obispo and Los Angeles counties. Lorayne started her musical career by singing in the White Memorial Seventh-day Adventist church choir, Los Angeles, at age 13. She went on to sing in and direct small groups, summer choirs, and eventually the Sanctuary Choir, serving the White Memorial Church for more than 40 years. Her early formal music training was in the form of private piano and violin lessons. She attended Occidental College, Los Angeles, and earned the B.A. and M.A. degrees, with emphasis in choral conducting, under the tutelage of Howard Swan. The music for “God Be in My Head” was written during this educational experience. The original was in the key of C and written chorally for a six-part choir. She changed the key to D to accommodate the two basses in her choir who could sing a low D but not a low C. SDAH has simplified it to four-part harmony, preserving all of her original progressions, and chose her original key of C to make the high notes easier for a congregation. This piece has traveled all over the world in manuscript form, becoming a solid favorite with Adventist choirs; this is its first time in a hymn book.\n\nLorayne and her physician husband, Sam Coombs, now enjoy retirement in San Dimas, California.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

A member of the Baptist church and an active Sunday school worker, he wrote most of his hymns for use in Sunday school anniversaries. He was the manager of an insurance company. A book of his works, Princess Alice and Other Poems, was published in 1882. He died December 2, 1929, at Basford.\n\nERNSTEIN was composed to be used with “Summer Suns Are Glowing” in the Methodist Sunday School Tune Book, 1881. The tune was first matched with “Holy Spirit, Hear Us” in the Revised Church Hymnary, 1930.\n\nJames Fredrick Swift was born December 28, 1847, in Manchester, England, but he received his education in Liverpool. At the age of 16 his talent secured him the job of organist at Cranmer Wesleyan Church, Liverpool. Later he served also at St. Andrew’s and St. Bride’s churches. For several years he was the conductor of three choral societies in Liverpool. Some and ballads, many of which achieved wide success in his time, were 200 songs published under his pseudonym, “Godfrey Marks.” ERNSTEIN seems to be the only one of his hymn tunes still in use. He died at Liscard, Cheshire, January 9, 1931.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "historicalContext": "Isaac Watts (1674-1748; see Biographies) included this hymn in five stanzas in his Psalms of David Imitated in the Language of the New Testament, 1719. In this book, Psalm 118 is given in four parts; this is the first stanza of part four, entitled “Hosanna; The Lord’s Day: or, Christ’s Resurrection, and our Salvation.”\n\nWatts appends a note as follows: “This is the day wherein Christ fulfilled His sufferings, and rose from the dead, has honored it with His own name. Rev. 1:10. The Lord’s Day. Note on st. 3, refer to Matt. 21:9. Hosanna save, we beseech.” Obviously Watts had Sunday, his regular day of worship, in mind, but the first stanza identifies the day as “His own,” which according to Mark 2:28 is, of course, the seventh-day Sabbath. The actual context of Psalm 118:24 does not specify any particular day of the week.\n\nTWENTY FOURTH first appeared in John Wyeth’s Repository of Sacred Music, Part Second, 1813, printed in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. It was with the Isaac Watts text “Salvation! Oh the joyful sound.” Several Chapins were active in church music during this time, the most well-known of which were brothers, Amzi and Lucius. Both have been given credit for TWENTY FOURTH, but some scholars lean toward Lucius. SDAH uses the tune again in a higher key and in a unison setting, at No. 406, which see for further comment on Lucius Chapin (1760-1842).\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E.

    "historicalContext": "This adaptation of Simeon’s prayer, known as the Nunc Dimittis, comes – from the first words of the Latin Vulgate version of Luke 2:29-32. Many poets have versified these words, and even in the days when only metrical versions of the psalms were permitted in church, some editors added this to the psalter, to be sung at the close of a service.\n\nFord Lewis Battles was born January 30, 1915, in Erie, Pennsylvania. He graduated from West Virginia University in 1936 and received his M.A. from Tufts University in 1938. Appointed a Rhodes Scholar that same year, he entered Exeter College, Oxford University, where he studied chiefly under the noted theologian and author, C. S. Lewis. During World War II he served (1940-1945) in the Air Force intelligence bureau. His Ph.D. was earned in medieval church history from the Hartford Seminary Foundation in 1950. He joined the faculty and taught there until 1966. From then until 1978 he taught at Pittsburgh Theological Seminary; his final year of service, before his death in 1979, was at Calvin Theological Seminary. Battles is known chiefly as a Calvin scholar and translator of the modern English edition of Calvin’s Institutes. He also pioneered in the use of the computer for scholarly purposes, producing a Computerized Concordance to Calvin’s Institutes. He authored John Calvin’s Commentary on Seneca’s De Clementia, The Piety of Calvin, and numerous other works. Among his many awards were the Guggenheim Fellowship and the Fullbright Award. He loved to write hymn texts and was keenly interested in drawing on the treasury of the great writings of the church for the use of modern congregations. For seven years he was a member of the hymnal committee for the United Church of Christ.\n\nRonald A. Nelson (his father’s name on citizenship papers reads “Nilsson”) was born April 29, 1927, in Rockford, Illinois. He graduated summa cum laude from St. Olaf College, and earned the M.Mus. degree from University of Wisconsin at Madison. During a time as a music teacher in the public schools of Rockford, he served as organist-choirmaster for Tabor Lutheran and Our Saviour’s Lutheran churches in the same city. Since 1955, he has held the position of music director for Westwood Lutheran Church, St.  Louis Park, Minnesota, which includes work with eight choirs from 3-year-olds to adults, and directing the parish school, which offers instruction in sightsinging, worship, and the arts. Nelson is a highly respected clinician at music institutes, choir camps, and festivals; he has done this work in 36 states and four Canadian provinces. He does promotional and development work for Augsburg Publishing House; they have 32 of his anthems in print, plus three cantatas: The Passion According to St. Mark, How Far Is It to Bethlehem? and Who Is My Neighbor? He has other anthems in print by Calvary Press, Broadman, and Choristers Guild. A member of the hymn music committee for the Lutheran Book of Worship, 1978, Nelson wrote one of the new settings for the service of Communion. A recent letter from him gives this statement: “The primary focus of my work has been on music as ‘servant’ in worship. Most satisfying experiences come when music for a given service amplifies and expands on the theme for that particular day. The emphasis of choir school is on service -one way in which even a 3-year-old can begin to serve the church. “The primary role of all choirs is leadership in worship. This must imply quality as well as thematic unity.”\n\nThis benediction response is in the free rhythm of speech, so no time signature is given. The smoothly flowing melody arrives approximately at its climax on the word “glory.”\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "William Pennefather wrote this hymn “For Divine Worship” while he was a Church of England pastor at Barnet, and later at Mildmay, England. He instituted historical conferences that resulted in establishing large religious and charitable organizations. His many hymns, published first in leaflets, were written to be sung at these meetings. Seventy-one of these pieces were published soon after his death in 1873, titled Original Hymns and Thoughts in Verse. John Julian says, “His hymns possess much beauty and earnest simplicity; are rich in evangelical sentiment and doctrine; and are much more musical than is usual with lyrics of their class.” The hymn is based on John 20:21.\n\nPennefather was born February 5, 1816, in Dublin, Ireland, the son of a baron of the Irish Exchequer. After education at Trinity College, Dublin, he was ordained in 1841 and in succession ministered to several churches in Ireland; from 1848 he pastored in England. He was responsible for introducing into England the Order of Deaconesses. He died April 30, 1873, at Muswell Hill, Middlesex.\n\nBEMERTON was first printed in Filitz’s Choralbuch, 1847, where it was set to a German text, which translated was “O let him whose sorrow.” Bemerton is the name of a parish near Salisbury where George Herbert (see SDAH 9) was the pastor. The charm of this tune lies in its utter simplicity and lack of pretension, using only stepwise progression of the diatonic scale over a compass of an interval of the sixth.\n\nFriedrich Filitz was born March 16, 1804, at Arnstadt, Germany. He worked in Berlin from 1843 until 1847, then moved to Munich. He assisted in the publication of a collection of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century chorales in 1845, and his own Vierstimmiges Choralbuch (Four-Voice Book of Cho- rales), for which he is best known, was published in 1847. He died at Munich, Germany, on December 8, 1876.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

Then he studied music under Horatio Palmer (1834-1907) but earned his living as a pharmacist. He edited several music compilations and was a choir director in Buffalo, New York, from 1903 to 1925.

He completed study at Northwestern University for the B.Mus. degree in 1936, and the Ph.D. in 1944. Later he did graduate study at Harvard University Theological School. His teaching career in the SDA church included Lodi Normal Institute (where he led music for the preaching of E. G. White, S. N. Haskell, and J. N. Loughborough); Clinton German Seminary, four years; head of the music department, Union College, seven years; Broadview College (now Academy), 10 years; Atlantic Union College, two years; Washington Missionary College, four years; and Loma Linda University, four years. For 23 years he taught at his alma mater, Northwestern University, the last 14 years of which were as chairman of the department of church music, successor to Peter Christian Lutkin (see SDAH 669). He is recognized as one of the founders of the SDA Church Musician’s Guild, and the founder of the Endowment Fund for a chair in sacred music at the Theological Seminary, Andrews University. He edited and published a hymnal especially for musicians entitled Te Decet Laus (To Him Belongeth Praise), 1970, which is still being sold.\n\nHis productive life spanned 70 years, closely crowded with voice teaching; choir building and directing in Methodist, Presbyterian, and SDA churches across the country (Chicago, Detroit, Brooklyn, Toledo, Boston, and several California churches); oratorio choral work; church music institutes; and research in hymnology.

    "historicalContext": "Born November 20, 1926, into a family of 14 children, at an early age Eleanor Wright showed a special gift for music. Though she had no formal training, her musicianship and skill at the piano continued to grow naturally, with a little help from her brother-in-law, Dale Wright, who taught her to play guitar chords on the piano. Married to Harold Wright at age 18, her first public performance was with the Wright Family Ensemble. Later her famous Blend-Wright Trio was heard in concerts all over the United States and in Bermuda and Switzerland. Eleanor is now an accomplished professional singer, composer, pianist, and arranger, with some 200 songs to her credit. Her work includes anthems, children’s songs, gospel songs, and wedding songs, many of which have been recorded by a variety of well-known artists. As a successful piano teacher for children, she developed, wrote, and illustrated the Keyboard Cousins Method of instruction. One of her songs, “Hallelujah, Home at Last,” was recorded by Del Delker, soloist with the Voice of Prophecy. As a recording artist Eleanor has been affiliated with Chapel Records and Savoy Recordings. Lately she has started her own music company with her own Eleanor Wright recording label. Besides being the mother of six children and grandmother of nine, she finds great joy in gourmet cooking, painting, interior decorating, gardening, and shortwave radio. But her strength and creativity come from a commitment to serve and honor God above all else.\n\nShe has been in demand as a speaker for seminars on music and the church, and served on the advisory committee of 90 people who assisted by correspondence the SDAH Committee. Eleanor’s music has been published by Manna Music, Screen Gems, and Arioso Music.\n\nFrom her home in Germantown, Ohio, Eleanor continues to write and sing and speak, witnessing for the Lord at every opportunity. After some 40 years of dedicated service to the ministry of music, her excitement is as keen as if her work were just beginning. Her vision of reaching the world with the love of God in song is as vivid as ever.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.

    "historicalContext": "This single stanza was printed on a card published by Skeffington &. Sons, Ltd., and was deposited in the British Museum on March 18, 1915. Credit there is given to St. Richard, bishop of Chichester (1197-1253). Born Richard DeWycke in Droitwich, England, he studied at Oxford University, then at Paris and Bologna. Known as one of the great crusade preachers in England, he was appointed chancellor of Oxford University and later chancellor of Canterbury. In spite of opposition of King Henry III, he was elected the bishop of Chichester. Recognized as a severe disciplinarian and defender of the standards of the church, he was canonized by Pope Urban IV in 1262. In Sussex, England, the festival of St. Richard was observed on April 3 until the days of the Reformation.\n\nThe lovely tune of this response, which can be appropriate before or after prayer, or as a benediction, was composed by Harold Friedell (1905-1958), a successful organist and composer who worked in several Episcopal churches in New York. He also composed the tune UNION SEMINARY, SDAH 259.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988.",

    "historicalContext": "The tune BENEDICTION was composed in 1934 by LeRoy Edwin Froom to provide a suitable closing item for the choir or the congregation. As was his undeviating custom, he wrote the tune first and then added appropriate words. A large percentage of composers would say that they work the other way around-the music is inspired by the rhythm and meaning of the words.\n\nLeRoy Edwin Froom was born October 16, 1890. After study at Pacific Union College and Walla Walla College, he graduated from Washington Training Center, now Columbia Union College, Takoma Park, Maryland. He began his ministry pastoring the Cambridge, Maryland, SDA church. After a short time as pastor at Wilmington, Delaware, he was called to Pacific Press Publishing Association to train as an editor. In 1918 he went to China and was editor of the Chinese Signs of the Times, also doing graduate study at University of Nanking. Back in the States, he edited the Watchman magazine for a time. From 1926 to 1950 he served in the Ministerial Association of the General Conference, first as associate, then as secretary. In 1927 he founded and continued as editor of Ministry magazine. From 1950 to 1958 he was a field secretary for the General Conference and also taught historical theology at the Theological Seminary, Andrews University. Among the many books he authored are the four-volume Prophetic Faith of our Fathers, the two-volume Conditionalist Faith of our Fathers, and The Holy Spirit-Executive of the Godhead, which he had nearly completed at the time of his death. He was a member of the committee for Church Hymnal, 1941, and was the spearhead for the publication in 1944 of the evangelistic songbook Gospel Melodies. He died at Takoma Park, Maryland, on February 20, 1974.\n\nReference: Companion to the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal by Wayne Hooper and Edward E. White.
